(Linux, Mac OS, Windows)\n* Support for Python 2.6 or later and **Jython**.\n* Support many different selectors\n    * ``select.kqueue`` (BSD, Mac OS)\n    * ``select.devpoll`` (Solaris)\n    * ``select.epoll`` (Linux 2.5.44+)\n    * ``select.poll`` (Linux, Mac OS)\n    * ``select.select`` - (Linux, Mac OS, Windows)\n* Support for `PEP 475 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0475/>`_ (Retries system calls on interrupt)\n* Support for modules which monkey-patch the standard library after import (like greenlet, gevent)\n* Support for systems which define a selector being available but don't actually implement it. ()\n\nAbout\n-----\n\nThis module was originally written by me for the `urllib3 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3>`_ project\n(history in PR `#1001 <https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/1001>`_) but it was decided that it would\nbe beneficial for everyone to have access to this work.\n\nAll the additional features that ``selectors2`` provides are real-world problems that have occurred\nand been reported during the lifetime of its maintenance and use within ``urllib3``.\n\nIf this work is useful to you, `feel free to say thanks <https://saythanks.io/to/SethMichaelLarson>`_,\ntakes only a little time and really brightens my day! :cake:\n\nCan this module be used in place of ``selectors``?\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nYes! This module is a 1-to-1 drop-in replacement for ``selectors`` and\nprovides all selector types that would be available in ``selectors`` including\n``DevpollSelector``, ``KqueueSelector``, ``EpollSelector``, ``PollSelector``, and ``SelectSelector``.\n\nWhat is different between `selectors2` and `selectors34`?\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis module is similar to ``selectors34`` in that it supports Python 2.6 - 3.3\nbut differs in that this module also implements PEP 475 for the backported selectors.\nThis allows similar behaviour between Python 3.5+ selectors and selectors from before PEP 475.\nIn ``selectors34``, an interrupted system call would result in an incorrect return of no events, which\nfor some use cases is not an acceptable behavior.\n\nI will also add here that ``selectors2`` also makes large improvements on the test suite surrounding it\nproviding 100% test coverage for each selector.  The test suite is also more robust and tests durability\nof the selectors in many different situations that aren't tested in ``selectors34``.\n\nWhat types of objects are supported?\n------------------------------------\n\nAt this current time ``selectors2`` only support the ``SelectSelector`` for Windows which cannot select on non-socket objects.\nOn Linux and Mac OS, both sockets and pipes are supported (some other types may be supported as well, such as fifos or special file devices).\n\nWhat if I have to support a platform without ``select.select``?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere are a few platforms that don't have a selector available, notably\nGoogle AppEngine. When running on those platforms any call to ``DefaultSelector()``\nwill raise a ``RuntimeError`` explaining that there are no selectors available.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThis module is dual-licensed under MIT and PSF License.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n``$ python -m pip install selectors2``\n\nUsage\n-----\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import sys\n    import selectors2 as selectors\n\n    # Use DefaultSelector, it picks the best\n    # selector available for your platform! :)\n    s = selectors.DefaultSelector()\n\n    import socket\n\n    # We're going to use Google as an example.\n    sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\n    sock.connect((\"www.google.com\", 80))\n\n    # Register the file to be watched for write availibility.\n    s.register(sock, selectors.EVENT_WRITE)\n\n    # Give a timeout in seconds or no\n    # timeout to block until an event happens.\n    events = s.select(timeout=1.0)\n\n    # Loop over all events that happened.\n    for key, event in events:\n        if event & selectors.EVENT_WRITE:\n            key.fileobj.send(b'HEAD / HTTP/1.1\\r\\n\\r\\n')\n\n    # Change what event you're waiting for.\n    s.modify(sock, selectors.EVENT_READ)\n\n    # Timeout of None let's the selector wait as long as it needs to.\n    events = s.select(timeout=None)\n    for key, event in events:\n        if event & selectors.EVENT_READ:\n            data = key.fileobj.recv(4096)\n            print(data)\n\n    # Stop watching the socket.\n    s.unregister(sock)\n    sock.close()\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\nRelease 2.0.2 (July 21, 2020)\n-----------------------------\n\n* [BUGFIX] Added support for ``long`` integers in Python 2.x.\n\nRelease 2.0.1 (August 17, 2017)\n-------------------------------\n\n* [BUGFIX] Timeouts would not be properly recalculated after receiving an EINTR error.\n\nRelease 2.0.0 (May 30, 2017)\n----------------------------\n\n* [FEATURE] Add support for Jython with ``JythonSelectSelector``.\n* [FEATURE] Add support for ``/dev/devpoll`` with ``DevpollSelector``.\n* [CHANGE] Raises a ``RuntimeError`` instead of ``ValueError`` if there is no selector available.\n* [CHANGE] No longer wraps exceptions in ``SelectorError``, raises original exception including\n  in timeout situations.\n* [BUGFIX] Detect defects in a system that defines a selector but does not implement it.\n* [BUGFIX] Can now detect a change in the ``select`` module after import such as when\n  ``gevent.monkey.monkey_patch()`` is called before importing ``selectors2``.\n\nRelease 1.1.1 (February 6, 2017)\n--------------------------------\n\n* [BUGFIX] Platforms that define ``select.kqueue`` would not have ``KqueueSelector`` as the ``DefaultSelector``.\n\nRelease 1.1.0 (January 17, 2017)\n--------------------------------\n\n* [FEATURE] Make system calls faster for Python versions that support PEP 475.\n* [FEATURE] Wheels are now universal.\n\nRelease 1.0.0 (November 3, 2016)\n--------------------------------\n\n* Initial implementation of ``selectors2``.\n\n\n","description_content_type":"","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://www.github.com/sethmlarson/selectors2","keywords":"async,file,socket,select,backport","license":"MIT","maintainer":"Seth
