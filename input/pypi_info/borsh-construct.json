It is meant to be used in security-critical projects as it prioritizes consistency, safety, speed, and comes with a strict specification.\n\nRead the [Documentation](https://near.github.io/borsh-construct-py/).\n## Installation\n\n```sh\npip install borsh-construct\n\n```\n\n\n### Development Setup\n\n1. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)\n2. Install dev dependencies:\n```sh\npoetry install\n\n```\n3. Install [nox-poetry](https://github.com/cjolowicz/nox-poetry) (note: do not use Poetry to install this, see [here](https://medium.com/@cjolowicz/nox-is-a-part-of-your-global-developer-environment-like-poetry-pre-commit-pyenv-or-pipx-1cdeba9198bd))\n4. Activate the poetry shell:\n```sh\npoetry shell\n\n```\n\n### Quick Tests\n```sh\npytest\n\n```\n\n### Full Tests\n```sh\nnox\n\n```\n\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/near/borsh-construct-py","keywords":"","license":"MIT","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"borsh-construct","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/borsh-construct/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/borsh-construct/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://github.com/near/borsh-construct-py","Repository":"https://github.com/near/borsh-construct-py"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/borsh-construct/0.1.0/","requires_dist":["construct-typing (>=0.5.1,<0.6.0)","sumtypes (>=0.1a5,<0.2)"],"requires_python":">=3.8.3,<4.0.0","summary":"Python implementation of Borsh serialization, built on the Construct library.","version":"0.1.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":11779428,"releases":{"0.1.0":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"211d52c0741626a17eb1a2f554e27dc2883f9bb98bb7b2392f9cbd1f39c36fea","md5":"2a40cd8b670198d43641864f78a47d20","sha256":"f584c791e2a03f8fc36e6c13011a27bcaf028c9c54ba89cd70f485a7d1c687ed"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"borsh_construct-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"2a40cd8b670198d43641864f78a47d20","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.8.3,<4.0.0","size":6386,"upload_time":"2021-10-20T11:16:47","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-10-20T11:16:47.840792Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/21/1d/52c0741626a17eb1a2f554e27dc2883f9bb98bb7b2392f9cbd1f39c36fea/borsh_construct-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"8e0c8062d8d795e7b9518923bfba453f883e2cbf80c5b05de699e4424a523a71","md5":"b9ff411305de7d1d6dfe2951ff017c25","sha256":"c916758ceba70085d8f456a1cc26991b88cb64233d347767766473b651b37263"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"borsh-construct-0.1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"b9ff411305de7d1d6dfe2951ff017c25","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.8.3,<4.0.0","size":5808,"upload_time":"2021-10-20T11:16:49","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-10-20T11:16:49.095344Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8e/0c/8062d8d795e7b9518923bfba453f883e2cbf80c5b05de699e4424a523a71/borsh-construct-0.1.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"211d52c0741626a17eb1a2f554e27dc2883f9bb98bb7b2392f9cbd1f39c36fea","md5":"2a40cd8b670198d43641864f78a47d20","sha256":"f584c791e2a03f8fc36e6c13011a27bcaf028c9c54ba89cd70f485a7d1c687ed"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"borsh_construct-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"2a40cd8b670198d43641864f78a47d20","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.8.3,<4.0.0","size":6386,"upload_time":"2021-10-20T11:16:47","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-10-20T11:16:47.840792Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/21/1d/52c0741626a17eb1a2f554e27dc2883f9bb98bb7b2392f9cbd1f39c36fea/borsh_construct-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"8e0c8062d8d795e7b9518923bfba453f883e2cbf80c5b05de699e4424a523a71","md5":"b9ff411305de7d1d6dfe2951ff017c25","sha256":"c916758ceba70085d8f456a1cc26991b88cb64233d347767766473b651b37263"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"borsh-construct-0.1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"b9ff411305de7d1d6dfe2951ff017c25","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.8.3,<4.0.0","size":5808,"upload_time":"2021-10-20T11:16:49","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-10-20T11:16:49.095344Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8e/0c/8062d8d795e7b9518923bfba453f883e2cbf80c5b05de699e4424a523a71/borsh-construct-0.1.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
