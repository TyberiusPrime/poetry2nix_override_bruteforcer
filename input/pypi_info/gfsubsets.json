Blank lines and comment lines beginning `#` are\nignored.\n\nThe editable definitions are similar, but for convenience allow the following\n\"directives\":\n\n* Two codepoints separated by `..` denote an (inclusive) range; all codepoints\n  within the range are included.\n* The symbol `-` before a codepoint or range excludes it from the output set.\n* The directive `@include(filename)` includes the codepoints in `filename`.\n* The directive `@block(XYZ)` includes the codepoints in the Unicode block\n  named `XYZ`.\n* The directive `@script(XYZ)` includes all codepoints with either the\n  Unicode `Script` property equal to `XYZ` or the `ScriptExtensions` property\n  equal to XYZ\n\nThese editable definitions are turned into their machine-readable equivalents\nusing the script `scripts/preprocess_namfile.py`.\n\n## Python interface\n\nThis repository also includes the Python module `gfsubsets` which provides\nan interface to these subset definitions. It exports the following functions:\n\n* `CodepointsInFont(filename)`: Lists the Unicode codepoints supported by the font\n* `ListSubsets()`: Returns the name of all defined subsets.\n* `SubsetsForCodepoint(cp)`: Returns the names of all subsets including the codepoint.\n* `SubsetForCodepoint(cp)`: Returns the name of the \"most relevant\" subset including the codepoint.\n* `CodepointsInSubset(subset)`: Returns a set of codepoints included in the subset.\n* `SubsetsInFont(filename, min_pct, ext_min_pct)`: Returns the name of subsets \"well\" supported by a font.\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":null,"downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":null,"keywords":null,"license":"Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004 http://www.apache.org/licenses/  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION  1.
