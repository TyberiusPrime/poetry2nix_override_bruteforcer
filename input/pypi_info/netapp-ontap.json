It provides support for several underlying services, including connection\nmanagement, asynchronous request processing, and exception handling. By using the Python\nclient library, you can quickly develop robust code to support the automation of your ONTAP\ndeployments.\n\n# Getting started\nThe Python client library is available as the package **netapp_ontap** at the Python Package\nIndex (PyPi) web site at https://pypi.org/project/netapp-ontap\n\n## Software requirements\nBefore installing the Python client library, you must make sure the following packages are\ninstalled on your system:  \n\n* python 3.6 or later    \n* requests 2.26.0 or later   \n* requests-toolbelt 0.9.1 or later\n* marshmallow 3.2.1 or later  \n\nThe library requires version 1.26.7 or later of urllib3 due to outstanding CVEs against\nolder versions. It also requires version 2022.12.7 of certifi due to a CVE that removed\nroot certificates from TrustCor from the root store. However, it will still work with older\nversions of urllib3 and certifi as long as the versions of urllib3 and certifi are compatible\nwith the requests package.\n\n\n## Installing and importing the package\nYou must install the package using the pip utility:\n\n```\npip install netapp-ontap\n```\n\nAfter installing the package, you can import the objects you need into your application:\n\n```python\nfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volume, Snapshot\n```\n\n## Creating an object\n\nYou can create an object in several different ways. Here are three examples of\ncreating an equivalent `Volume` object.\n\n```python\nfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volume\n\n# Example 1 - keyword arguments\nvolume = Volume(name='vol1', svm={'name': 'vs1'}, aggregates=[{'name': 'aggr1'}])\n\n# Example 2 - dict as keyword arguments\ndata = {\n    'name': 'vol1',\n    'svm': {'name': 'vs1'},\n    'aggregates': [{'name': 'aggr1'}],\n}\nvolume = Volume(**data)\n\n# Example 3 - using the from_dict() method\nvolume = Volume.from_dict({\n    'name': 'vol1',\n    'svm': {'name': 'vs1'},\n    'aggregates': [{'name': 'aggr1'}],\n})\n```\n\n## Performing actions on an object\n\nAfter you create an object, you can perform actions on the object based\non the purpose and design of your application. The example below illustrates\nhow to create a new volume and then take a snapshot.\n\nNote that when using the library, in all cases you must first establish a\nconnection to the management LIF of the ONTAP system using the\n`netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` object. In the example below,\nthe connection is created and then set as the global default.\nThis means that all objects and the associated actions reuse\nthis same connection. See *Host connections* for more information.\n\n```python\nfrom netapp_ontap import config, HostConnection\nfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volume, Snapshot\n\nconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password')\n\nvolume = Volume(name='vol1', svm={'name': 'vs1'}, aggregates=[{'name': 'aggr1'}])\nvolume.post()\nsnapshot = Snapshot.from_dict({\n    'name': '%s_snapshot' % volume.name,\n    'comment': 'A snapshot of %s' % volume.name,\n    'volume': volume.to_dict(),\n})\nsnapshot.post()\n```\n\n# Host connections\n\nThe `netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` object allows a client application\nto store credentials once and reuse them for each subsequent operation.\nYou can do this in any of the following ways:\n\n* Call the function `set_connection()` on a specific resource so the connection is used for\nall actions on the resource.\n\n* Set the `netapp_ontap.config.CONNECTION` variable to establish a single connection instance for all\noperations within the scope of that block. This allows you to connect to ONTAP once\nand use the same connection everywhere, instead of providing credentials every time you make a\nrequest.\n\nNote that you can call `get_connection()` to get the connection used by an object and use it for\nsubsequent operations.\n\nBy default, every operation attempts to verify the SSL certificate for the connection. If a\ncertificate cannot be verified, the **SSLError** exception is thrown. You can disable this\nverification by setting `netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection.verify` to false when creating the\n`netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` instance.\n\n## Custom headers\n\nIn some cases, you might want to set and send custom headers with the REST request.\nThis can be done at the connection level. For a specific connection, you can pass in\nthe headers you would like to send for each request within the scope of that connection object.\nThe library provides full access to the request headers so that you can update, add, or delete\nheaders from the same connection object at any point. If a header is not recognized by ONTAP,\nit is ignored.\n\n```python\nfrom netapp_ontap import config, HostConnection\nheaders = {'my-header1':'my-header-value1', 'my-header2':'my-header-value2'}\n\n# Initialize a connection object with custom headers\nconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password', headers=headers)\n\n# Delete a header from a connection object\nconn = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password', headers=headers)\ndel conn.request_headers['my-header1']\n\n# Add a header to a connection object using the assignment operator\nconn = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username', 'password', headers=headers)\nconn.request_headers['mynew-header'] = 'mynew-header-value'\n\n# Add headers to a connection object\nconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', 'username' 'password')\nconfig.CONNECTION.request_headers = headers\n\n# Update an existing header using the assignment operator\nconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com','username','password', headers=headers)\nconfig.CONNECTION.request_headers['my-header1'] = 'my-new-header'\n```\n\n# Asynchronous processing and jobs\n\nAll POST, PATCH, and DELETE requests that can take more than two seconds to complete are\ndesigned to run asynchronously as non-blocking operations. These operations are executed\nas background jobs at the ONTAP cluster. The HTTP response generated by an\nasynchronous request always contains a link to the associated job object. By default, an\nasynchronous request automatically polls the job using the unique job identifier in the link.\nControl is returned to your script when a terminal state is reached (success or failure) or\nthe configured timeout value expires. However, you can override this behavior by setting the\n**poll** value to false when calling the function, causing control to return before the job\ncompletes. Forcing an immediate return can be useful when a job might take a long time to\ncomplete and you want to continue execution of the script.\n\n# Responses\n\nA request always returns a `netapp_ontap.response.NetAppResponse` object which contains the details\nof the HTTP response. It contains information such as whether the response is an error\nor a job. Refer to `netapp_ontap.response.NetAppResponse` for further information on how\nto check the details of the response.\n\n# Exception handling\n\nBy default, an exception is returned if a request returns an HTTP status code of 400 or greater.\nThe exception object, which is of type `netapp_ontap.error.NetAppRestError`,\nholds the HTTP response object so that the exception can be handled in the client code.\nIf you wish not to raise exceptions, you can set `netapp_ontap.config.RAISE_API_ERRORS` to false. In this case,\nit is up to the client to check the HTTP response from the `netapp_ontap.response.NetAppResponse`\nobject and handle any errors. Refer to `netapp_ontap.error.NetAppRestError` for further information.\n\n```python\n# Set RAISE_API_ERRORS to False and check the HTTP response.\nconfig.RAISE_API_ERRORS = False\nresponse = Svm.find(name=\"nonexistent_vs\")\nassert \"entry doesn't exist\" in response.http_response.text\n```\n\n# Debugging\n\nWhile writing your application, it can often be useful to see the raw HTTP request and response\ntext that the library is sending to and from the server. There are two flags that can be set\nto help with this.\n\n## DEBUG flag\n\nThe first is the DEBUG flag. This can be set either by setting DEBUG=1 in the environment prior\nto executing your application or by setting `netapp_ontap.utils.DEBUG` to 1 inside of your application.\nThis flag, when set, will cause the library to log the request and response for any failed\nAPI call. This will be logged at DEBUG level (see the section on logging for setting up your\napplication). Here's an example of setting this value inside of your application:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nfrom netapp_ontap import HostConnection, NetAppRestError, config, utils\nfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volume\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\nconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('10.100.200.50', username='admin', password='password', verify=False)\n\n# Set the DEBUG flag to 1\nutils.DEBUG = 1\n\n# this API call will fail with a 404\ntry:\n    volume = Volume(uuid=\"1\", name='does_not_exist')\n    volume.get()\nexcept NetAppRestError:\n    print('We got an expected exception')\n```\n\nHere is what the output would look like:\n\n```\n$ python test_debug.py\nDEBUG:urllib3.util.retry:Converted retries value: 5 -> Retry(total=5, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTPS connection (1): 10.100.200.50:443\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:https://10.100.200.50:443 \"GET /api/storage/volumes/1 HTTP/1.1\" 404 130\nDEBUG:netapp_ontap.utils:\n-----------REQUEST-----------\nGET https://10.100.200.50:443/api/storage/volumes/1\nAccept: */*\nUser-Agent: python-requests/2.21.0\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nX-Dot-Client-App: netapp-ontap-python-9.8.0\nAuthorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQK\nNone\n-----------------------------\n\n-----------RESPONSE-----------\n404 Not Found\nDate:Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:00:24 GMT\nServer:libzapid-httpd\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nCache-Control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate\nContent-Length: 130\nContent-Type: application/hal+json\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100\nConnection:Keep-Alive\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"message\": \"\"1\" is an invalid value for field \"uuid\" (<UUID>)\",\n    \"code\": \"2\",\n    \"target\": \"uuid\"\n  }\n}\n------------------------------\nWe got an expected exception\n$\n```\n\n## LOG_ALL_API_CALLS flag\n\nThere is also a LOG_ALL_API_CALLS flag which can be set in the same ways. You can\nset it in the environment or during script execution by setting `netapp_ontap.utils.LOG_ALL_API_CALLS`\nto 1. This flag will produce the same output as above, but it will log the call no\nmatter if there was a failure or not. Here's an example of what that would look\nlike if we got an existing volume:\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nfrom netapp_ontap import HostConnection, config, utils\nfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Volume\n\nlogging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)\nconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('10.100.200.50', username='admin', password='password', verify=False)\n\n# Set the LOG_ALL_API_CALLS flag to 1\nutils.LOG_ALL_API_CALLS = 1\n\n# this API call will succeed and be logged\nvolume = list(Volume.get_collection())[0]\n```\n\nHere is what the output would look like:\n\n```\n$ python test_debug.py\nDEBUG:urllib3.util.retry:Converted retries value: 5 -> Retry(total=5, connect=None, read=None, redirect=None, status=None)\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:Starting new HTTPS connection (1): 10.100.200.50:443\nDEBUG:urllib3.connectionpool:https://10.100.200.50:443 \"GET /api/storage/volumes HTTP/1.1\" 200 567\nDEBUG:netapp_ontap.utils:\n-----------REQUEST-----------\nGET https://10.100.200.50:443/api/storage/volumes\nUser-Agent: python-requests/2.21.0\nConnection: keep-alive\nAccept: */*\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nX-Dot-Client-App: netapp-ontap-python-9.8.0\nAuthorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQK\nNone\n-----------------------------\n\n-----------RESPONSE-----------\n200 OK\nDate:Tue, 12 Nov 2019 13:14:01 GMT\nServer:libzapid-httpd\nX-Content-Type-Options: nosniff\nCache-Control: no-cache,no-store,must-revalidate\nContent-Length: 567\nContent-Type: application/hal+json\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100\nConnection:Keep-Alive\n{\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"c68bdca8-d090-11e9-bb29-005056bb7f42\",\n      \"name\": \"vs0_root\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/storage/volumes/c68bdca8-d090-11e9-bb29-005056bb7f42\"\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"uuid\": \"ed3b6ebf-d48e-11e9-bb29-005056bb7f42\",\n      \"name\": \"vs1_root\",\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/storage/volumes/ed3b6ebf-d48e-11e9-bb29-005056bb7f42\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"num_records\": 2,\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/storage/volumes\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n------------------------------\n$\n```\n\n# Additional considerations\n\nIn most cases, the objects and actions in the library can be mapped directly\nto equivalent cURL commands run against the ONTAP REST interface. However, there are a few\nexceptions you should be aware of.\n\n## Property names\n\nIf a property of a resource is named the same as one of the Python reserved names,\nthe name is transposed when accessing the member of the resource. For example,\nif there is a resource named \"Foo\" that has a property defined in the API named \"class\",\nthe property name would instead be \"class_\" when using the library. For example:\n\n```python\nfrom netapp_ontap.resources import Foo\n\nfoo = Foo()\nfoo.class_ = \"high\"\n```\n\n## Action methods\n\nSome resources may have additional methods aside from the generic get(), post(),\npatch(), etc. These are known as \"action methods\" and will send requests to an\nendpoint matching the same name. For example, the `netapp_ontap.resources.security_certificate.SecurityCertificate`\nresource has the `netapp_ontap.resources.security_certificate.SecurityCertificate.sign()` method.\nUsing this method will make a POST call to /api/security/certificates/{uuid}/sign.\n\nIf a resource has a field with the same name as an action method, then the name of\nthe action method will be changed so as to not conflict. In the above example, if\nthe SecurityCertificate object had a field called `sign`, then the name of the action\nmethod would be `sign_action()` instead.\n\n# Documentation\n\nTo view the latest documentation, visit https://devnet.netapp.com/restapi.php , click on the\n\"Python Client Library\" tab, and then choose the latest version of the docs. You can also view\nthe ONTAP REST API docs linked from the same page under the \"Overview\" tab.\n\nIf you want to view this library's docs offline, then you can locate the copy installed in\n`<python_environment>/lib/<python_version>/site_packages/netapp_ontap/docs`.\n\n# Compatibility\n\nThe version assigned to the library consists of the major ONTAP release it is generated\nfrom and a minor version for the library within that release. For example: within the\nONTAP 9.7 product family, the library may ship several fix releases by incrementing the\nminor index: 9.7.0, 9.7.1, 9.7.2. The minor version\nallows the library to be updated at a cadence separate from ONTAP.\n\nClient libraries that have the same major version as ONTAP are completely compatible.\nFor example, the libraries netapp-ontap-9.6.1 and netapp-ontap-9.6.4 are fully\ncompatible with both ONTAP 9.6 and ONTAP 9.6P1.\n\nA client library will support N-1 major versions of ONTAP with full backwards compatibility\nof all APIs and fields. For example, a program written using client library 9.6.1 and\ntalking to ONTAP 9.6 will continue to function consistently when the client library is\nupdated to 9.7.0.\n\nA client library with a major version less than the ONTAP release can still be\nused, however it will not be able to access any of the new REST APIs. For example, the library\nnetapp-ontap-9.6.4 is only partially compatible with ONTAP 9.7. In this case, the library will\nnot have access to the newer APIs or fields offered by ONTAP, but scripts can continue to\naccess any of the same 9.6 fields they were before without issue.\n\nFor example a new property **volume.is_svm_root** was added with ONTAP 9.7.\nThe following behaviors would be seen with different libraries and ONTAP combinations:\n\n* library 9.6.0 would ignore the value coming from an ONTAP 9.7 response\n\n* library 9.7.0 would fully support the property coming from an ONTAP 9.7+ response\n\n* library 9.7.0 would not produce any errors for that property coming from an ONTAP 9.6 response\n\n# Changelog\n\nThere are several changes to the Python Client Library and the ONTAP REST API, which are organized by release below.\n\n## 9.15.1 library updates\n\n**9.15.1.1 Patch**\n\n* Fixed an issue with the `netapp_ontap.resources.dns.Dns` resource not working properly due to incorrect URL construction.\n\n**New properties available on HostConnection creation**\n\nBoth `scheme` and `protocol_timeouts` had previously been settable on the HostConnection object, but only after construction.\nThese properties are now available when constructing the HostConnection object.\n`protocol_timeouts` is an optional tuple (default is `(6,45)`) with two values: `connection_timeout` and `read_timeout`.\nThese values represent the number of seconds to wait for the server to send data before giving up when either\nconnecting to the server or processing a request, respectively.\n\nHere is an example of configuring a HostConnection object with custom values for connection_timeout and read_timeout:\n\n```python\nfrom netapp_ontap import HostConnection\nconnection_timeout = 90\nread_timeout = 300\n\n# Initialize a connection object with custom protocol timeouts\nconfig.CONNECTION = HostConnection('myhost.mycompany.com', username='username', password='password', protocol_timeouts=(connection_timeout, read_timeout))\n```\n\n**`post_collection()` returns an empty list when job results link is missing**\n\nIn previous versions of the library, `resource.post_collection()` would fail without polling the job due to a missing job results\nlink in the response. This issue was specifically seen in the `/storage/volumes/{volume.uuid}/snapshots`\nendpoint, where the job results link was missing. In the 9.15.1 release, `netapp_ontap` will continue to poll the job until it\nreaches a terminal state. If the job is successful and new resources were created, `post_collection()` will succeed\nbut return an empty list and print a warning message. A subsequent `get_collection()` call with the proper query\nwill return the newly created resources.\n\n\nHere is an example of this behavior:\n\n```python\nsnap1_info = {\n    'name': \"example_snapshot_name\",\n    'svm': { 'name': \"my_svm\" },\n    'volume': {'uuid': \"82b5463c-9107-44ce-81a7-b07860aef1e9\" },\n}\n\nsnap2_info = {\n    'name': \"example_snapshot_name\",\n    'svm': { 'name': \"my_svm\" },\n    'volume': {'uuid': \"c5942f1e-860b-4141-9fec-79a008987580\" },\n}\n\nrecords = [Snapshot(**snap1_info), Snapshot(**snap2_info)]\nempty_results = Snapshot.post_collection(records, \"*\")\nprint(empty_results)\nresults = list(Snapshot.get_collection(\"*\", name=\"example_snapshot_name\"))\nprint(\"---- First Snapshot ----\")\nprint(results[0])\nprint(\"---- Second Snapshot ----\")\nprint(results[1])\n\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nWARNING:netapp_ontap.resource:No records could be identified as part of post_collection. Returning an empty list.\n[]\n---- First Snapshot ----\nSnapshot({'volume': {'name': 'volume1', 'uuid': '82b5463c-9107-44ce-81a7-b07860aef1e9', '_links': {'self': {'href': '/api/storage/volumes/82b5463c-9107-44ce-81a7-b07860aef1e9'}}}, 'name': 'example_snapshot_name', 'uuid': 'a975a952-84d3-4fcb-9666-05c76c3fee7c', '_links': {'self': {'href': '/api/storage/volumes/%2A/snapshots/a975a952-84d3-4fcb-9666-05c76c3fee7c'}}})\n---- Second Snapshot ----\nSnapshot({'volume': {'name': 'volume2', 'uuid': 'c5942f1e-860b-4141-9fec-79a008987580', '_links': {'self': {'href': '/api/storage/volumes/c5942f1e-860b-4141-9fec-79a008987580'}}}, 'name': 'example_snapshot_name', 'uuid': 'efcb6038-9d9b-466c-ae79-67f61fb21059', '_links': {'self': {'href': '/api/storage/volumes/%2A/snapshots/efcb6038-9d9b-466c-ae79-67f61fb21059'}}})\n```\n\n**Support for additional checks before `get()` to ensure that all keys are set**\n\nBy setting `netapp_ontap.config.STRICT_GET` to `True`, the library will automatically check that all keys are set on a resources before making a request as part of `get()`. If not all keys are set, the library will throw an exception that lists the missing keys. If `netapp_ontap.config.STRICT_GET` is set to false, the library will make the request even if some keys are missing.\n\n**Option to avoid polling resources when `Location` response header is incomplete**\n\nSetting `netapp_ontap.config.RETRY_ON_INCOMPLETE_LOCATION` to `False` will cause the library to immediately throw an exception if the full location of a resource cannot be determined from the 'Location' header after a `post()`. If the option is set to `True` (default), the library will attempt to poll the job until the full location is available or until it cannot find a location that contains all keys.\n\n**Option to redact sensitive fields from debug logs**\n\nTo prevent leakage of sensitive information in debug logs, three new configuration options are now supported to redact some fields from the debug logs. These options are:\n\n- `netapp_ontap.config.REDACT_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER`: Defaults to True. Replaces the value of the authorization header in the request with `*****`.\n- `netapp_ontap.config.REDACT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS`: Defaults to True. Replaces the values of logged sensitive fields in the body of responses and requests with `*****`.\n- `netapp_ontap.config.SENSITIVE_FIELDS`: Contains the list of field names that should be considered sensitive to avoid them from being logged. By default, the list contains \"password\", \"key\", \"certificate\", \"token\" as names of sensitive fields.\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nconfig.REDACT_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER = True\nconfig.REDACT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS = True\n\nmy_cluster = Cluster()\nmy_cluster.password = \"example_password1234\"\nmy_cluster.post()\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n-----------REQUEST-----------\nPOST https://<cluster_management_ip>:443/api/cluster\nUser-Agent: python-requests/2.28.1\nAccept-Encoding: gzip, deflate\nAccept: */*\nConnection: keep-alive\nX-Dot-Client-App: netapp-ontap-python-9.15.1.0\nContent-Type: application/json\nContent-Length: 36\nAuthorization: *****\n{\n  \"password\": \"*****\"\n}\n-----------------------------\n```\n\nAdding a field name to the `netapp_ontap.config.SENSITIVE_FIELDS` list will result in the field being redacted at all nesting levels of the request and response bodies.\n\nExample:\n\nTo redact all information about an IP address in the case of `get_collection` on an `IpInterface` resource, `\"address\"`, `\"family\"`, and `\"netmask\"` can be added to the `SENSITIVE_FIELDS` list.\n\n```python\nconfig.REDACT_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER = True\nconfig.REDACT_SENSITIVE_FIELDS = True\nconfig.SENSITIVE_FIELDS.extend([\"address\", \"family\", \"netmask\"])\n\nresources_collection = list(IpInterface.get_collection(fields='ip'))\n```\n\nOutput:\n\nNote that only string fields can be redacted. Specifying the name of a nested field like `\"ip\"` in the example above will **not** result in all of its sub-properties being redacted.\n\n```\n-----------RESPONSE-----------\n200 OK\nContent-Type: application/hal+json\nVary: Accept-Encoding,Origin\nContent-Encoding: gzip\nContent-Length: 365\nKeep-Alive: timeout=5, max=100\nConnection: Keep-Alive\n{\n  \"_links\": {\n    \"self\": {\n      \"href\": \"/api/network/ip/interfaces?fields=ip\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"num_records\": 3,\n  \"records\": [\n    {\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/network/ip/interfaces/0b6025c1-f835-11ee-a5b2-005056ae7e9d\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"ip\": {\n        \"address\": \"*****\",\n        \"family\": \"*****\",\n        \"netmask\": \"*****\"\n      },\n      \"name\": \"node_mgmt1_inet6\",\n      \"uuid\": \"0b6025c1-f835-11ee-a5b2-005056ae7e9d\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/network/ip/interfaces/183d576b-f835-11ee-ae3d-005056aef56b\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"ip\": {\n        \"address\": \"*****\",\n        \"family\": \"*****\",\n        \"netmask\": \"*****\"\n      },\n      \"name\": \"node_data4_inet6\",\n      \"uuid\": \"183d576b-f835-11ee-ae3d-005056aef56b\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"_links\": {\n        \"self\": {\n          \"href\": \"/api/network/ip/interfaces/18eb1d24-f835-11ee-ae3d-005056aef56b\"\n        }\n      },\n      \"ip\": {\n        \"address\": \"*****\",\n        \"family\": \"*****\",\n        \"netmask\": \"*****\"\n      },\n      \"name\": \"node_data6_inet6\",\n      \"uuid\": \"18eb1d24-f835-11ee-ae3d-005056aef56b\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n**New endpoints**\n\n* Endpoint: /storage/directory-restore  \n  Object: `netapp_ontap.resources.directory_restore.DirectoryRestore`  \n  HTTP methods: POST  \n  This API restores the source directory from the volume Snapshot copy on the destination directory.\n\n* Endpoint: /protocols/nfs/tls/interfaces  \n  Object: `netapp_ontap.resources.nfs_tls_interface.NfsTlsInterface`  \n  HTTP method: GET  \n  This API retrieves NFS over TLS interfaces.\n\n* Endpoint: /protocols/nfs/tls/interfaces/{interface.uuid}  \n  Object: `netapp_ontap.resources.nfs_tls_interface.NfsTlsInterface`  \n  HTTP method: GET, PATCH  \n  This API retrieves and updates an NFS over TLS interface.\n\n## 9.14.1 library updates\n\n**New `netapp_ontap` release cycle**\n\nStarting with 9.14.1, the Python Client Library (`netapp_ontap`) will have one release for each ONTAP release cycle\n(aligned with the ONTAP RC release). We will no longer have an RC and GA release for the library.\n\n**Resource properties can now be set to `None`**\n\nSome ONTAP REST endpoints accept null values in the request body, however, the Python library did not support this.\nStarting in 9.14.1 the Python client library will allow users to set resource properties to `None` and will include\nthese values as null in the request body. Here is an example:\n\n```python\n# Get an existing rule\nrule = S3BucketLifecycleRule(\"53714b3a-cd85-11ed-8980-005056aca578\",\"b51ed46b-cff7-11ed-8980-005056aca578\")\nrule.name = \"my_rule\"\nrule.get()\n# set the expiration to None\nrule.expiration = None\n# patch the rule\nrule.patch(hydrate=True)\n```\n\nHere is the resulting body of the request:\n\n```json\n{\"expiration\" : null}\n```\n\n**Resources can be more quickly retrieved using `fast_get_collection()`**\n\n`fast_get_collection()` is the quicker version of `get_collection()` that will fetch all records\nin the form of a RawResource type. It returns a generator that yields `netapp_ontap.raw_resource.RawResource` objects containing\ninformation about the resource as a dictionary. `netapp_ontap.raw_resource.RawResource` objects do not support, `get()`, `post()`,\n`patch()`, or `delete()`, but they can be converted to the appropriate resource type using\n`netapp_ontap.raw_resource.RawResource.promote`. `netapp_ontap.raw_resource.RawResource` objects should be treated as read-only.\n`fast_get_collection()` is significantly more efficient when there are many records in the response\nbecause it skips deserializing and validating the resource until the user explicitly\nasks by using `promote()`.\n\nHere is an example:\n\n```python\n# Get all the volumes quickly\nmy_volumes = list(Volume.fast_get_collection())\ndeleted_volumes = []\nfor record in my_volumes:\n  # Get the current volume name and state\n  volume_name = record.name\n  volume_state = record.state\n  # Delete the volume if the name starts with \"test_\" OR if the volume is offline\n  if volume_name.startswith(\"test_\") or volume_state == \"offline\":\n    # generate the resource object from this RawResource\n    volume = record.promote()\n    volume.delete()\n    deleted_volumes.append(volume_name)\nprint(f\"The following {len(deleted_volumes)} volumes were deleted:\")\nprint(\"\\n\".join(deleted_volumes))\n\n```\n\n**New endpoints**\n\n* Endpoint: /name-services/cache/host/settings/{uuid}  \n  HTTP methods: GET, PATCH  \n  This API retrieves and updates

For example: `Volume.count_collection(name=\"backup_vol*\")` is roughly equivalent to `len(list(Volume.get_collection(name=\"backup_vol*\")))`.\n\n* The application can now add its own custom headers for each request as part of the `netapp_ontap.host_connection.HostConnection` object.\n\n* When passing verify=False to the HostConnection, the library will now disable urllib3's InsecureRequestWarning from logging messages.\n\n**Fixed issues**\n\n* [Bug ID 1322090](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1322090)  \n  When polling jobs, the certificate verification setting was hard-coded to False, so it would behave the same regardless of how the user set it.\n\n* [Bug ID 1322095](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1322095) \n  The get_collection() call using the connection parameter was not correctly setting the connection on the returned resource objects.\n\n* [Bug ID 1279507](ihttps://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1279507)  \n  When doing a find() with the fields query parameter, the library was not returning the specified fields, instead, all fields were being returned.\n\n* [Bug ID 1291333](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1291333)  \n  When 0 records are found in a Resource.find() call and LOG_ALL_API_CALLS is set to True, then an uncaught exception is raised.\n\n* [Bug ID 1271450](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1271450)  \n  The library doesn't allow sending a body in a DELETE request.\n\n* [Bug ID 1263312](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1263312)  \n  When POSTing or PATCHing some objects with embedded objects, fields might incorrectly be dropped from the request.\n\n* [Bug ID 1275238](https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/bugs-online/product/ONTAP/BURT/1275238)  \n  Retrieving and setting the \"from\" field of Autosupport object fails.\n\n**Incompatibilities**\n\n* In prior versions, Resource.find() would raise an exception if no results were found as well as when more than one was found. In this version, when no results are found, None is returned instead of raising an exception. An exception is still raised when more than one result is found.\n\n\n\n##ONTAP 9.7 REST API updates\n\nAll new ONTAP APIs have corresponding library resource objects which can be used\nto perform the operations. See the `netapp_ontap.resources` package for details\nabout each of the objects and their fields.\n\nFor a summary of the changes in the ONTAP REST API between versions of ONTAP 9, see the [ONTAP 9
