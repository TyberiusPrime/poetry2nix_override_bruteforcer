Thus, one can create new UIs\nwithout reimplementing the underlying calendar functionality, and one can\nlikewise implement specialized calendar functionality while reusing the\nexisting UI.\n\nFor example, if you have a groupware system with a good calendaring UI but need\nto use an external server for your calendars, you should not need to rewrite\nthe user interface.\n\nA secondary goal is also to provide an API for calendaring to help people\naround some of the obstacles you will sooner or later arrive at, like how to\nhandle recurring events, searching, and more, by providing them with an API\nthat can handle the issues.\n\nThe two main concepts of this API are event providers, which are the sources of\nevents, and event users, which take the Events and display them, export them,\netc. More information on how to use Kalends to make an EventProvider is in\ndoc/PROVIDING.txt, and more information on how to use Kalends to get events\nfrom an EventProvider is in doc/USING.txt.\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\nAlthough the creation of Kalends was prompted by the desire to have one set of\nadvanced Kalendaring views available for all calendars in Plone, and although\nthe Component Architecture was created by Zope Corporation, Kalends is in no\nway specific to Plone, Zope or even web applications. It's a Python module,\ninstallable for any Python version (2.3 or later) on any system that can\ninstall the Component Architecture, which is pretty much any Python system with\na C compiler.\n\nKalends requires:\n- Python 2.3 or later (last version tested: 2.4.3)\n- zope.interface 3.2 or later (last version tested: 3.2.2)\n\n\nKnown implementations\n---------------------\nCurrently the Dateable (https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/dateable/)\nmodule set is using Kalends. It contains chronos, a set of views for Zope that \nimplements a Kalends UI, and Plone4ArtistCalendar, a Plone product that makes\nPlone folders into event providers.\n\n\n=========================\ndateable.kalends Changes\n=========================\n\n1.0 (2013-05-21)\n================\n\n* Updated the metadata.\n\ndateable.kalends 0.5
