It works for positive numbers upto the range of 999,999,999,999 (i.e. billions).\r\n\r\n++++++++++++\r\nInstallation\r\n++++++++++++\r\nPlease ensure that you have **updated pip** to the latest version before installing word2number.\r\n\r\nYou can install the module using Python Package Index using the below command.\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: python\r\n\r\n  pip install word2number\r\n\r\nMake sure you install all requirements given in requirements.txt\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: python\r\n\r\n  pip install -r requirements.txt\r\n\r\n+++++\r\nUsage\r\n+++++\r\nFirst you have to import the module using the below code.\r\n.. code-block:: python\r\n\r\n    from word2number import w2n\r\n\r\nThen you can use the **word_to_num** method to convert a number-word to numeric digits, as shown below.\r\n\r\n.. code-block:: python\r\n\r\n    >>> print w2n.word_to_num(\"two million three thousand nine hundred and eighty four\")\r\n    2003984\r\n\r\n    >>> print(w2n.word_to_num('two point three')) \r\n    2.3\r\n\r\n    >>> print(w2n.word_to_num('112')) \r\n    112\r\n\r\n    >>> print(w2n.word_to_num('point one')) \r\n    0.1\r\n\r\n    >>> print(w2n.word_to_num('one hundred thirty-five')) \r\n    135\r\n\r\n    >>> print(w2n.word_to_num('million million'))\r\n    Error: Redundant number! Please enter a valid number word (eg. two million twenty three thousand and forty nine)\r\n    None\r\n\r\n    >>> print(w2n.word_to_num('blah'))\r\n    Error: No valid number words found! Please enter a valid number word (eg. two million twenty three thousand and forty nine)\r\n    None\r\n\r\n+++++++++++\r\nBugs/Errors\r\n+++++++++++\r\n\r\nPlease ensure that you have updated pip to the latest version before installing word2number.\r\n\r\nIf you find any bugs/errors in the usage of above code, please raise an issue through `Github <http://github.com/akshaynagpal/w2n>`_. If you don't know how to use Github or raise an issue through it, I suggest that you should learn it.
