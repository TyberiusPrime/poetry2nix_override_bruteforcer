Unfortunately, pip doesn't offer an easy way to install that without performing a full dependency-tree resolution at install time, which slows down the process.\n\n**pip-resolved** was created as a thin wrapper around pip's existing functionality to allow users to install wheels with pre-resolved dependencies, without the need to package an extra requirements.txt or contraints file.\n\nThis is specially useful for **applications** (not libraries) that are being distributed as wheels with a fixed set of pinned dependencies to ensure reproducibility.\n\n## Installation\n\n### With pip\n```shell\n$ pip install pip-resolved\n```\n\n### With pipx\n```shell\n$ pipx install pip-resolved\n```\n\n## Usage\nAs simple as :point_down:\n```shell\n$ pip-resolved install <WHEEL>\n```\n\n\n## How it works\n**pip-resolved** extracts all pinned dependencies defined as `Requires-Dist` on your artifact metadata, generates a temporary requirements.txt file and executes the following command\n\n```shell\n$ pip install --no-deps -r requirements.txt <WHEEL>\n```\n\nThe `--no-deps` command is key to make sure pip doesn't attempt to resolve the whole dependency tree.\n\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"","keywords":"","license":"MIT","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"pip-resolved","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/pip-resolved/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/pip-resolved/","project_urls":null,"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/pip-resolved/0.3.0/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":">=3.7","summary":"Install
