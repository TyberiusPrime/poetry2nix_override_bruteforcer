As an example, in the case\nwhere one interface expects a file-like object to call `.read()` on, and the other only provides a\ngenerator of bytes.\n\nOne way to solve this issue would be to write all the bytes in the generator to a temporary file,\nthen provide that file instead, but if the generator produces a large amount of data then this is\nboth slow to start, and resource-intensive.\n\nThis library allows streaming data between these two incompatible interfaces so as data is requested\nby `.read()`, it's pulled from the iterable. This keeps resource usage low and removes the startup\ndelay.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n```\npip install iterable-io\n```\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nThe functionality of this library is accessed via a single function: `open_iterable()`.\n\n`open_iterable()` is designed to work the same was as the builtin `open()`, except that it takes an\niterable to \"open\" instead of a file. For example, it can open the iterable in binary or text mode,\nhas options for buffering, encoding, etc. See the docstring of `open_iterable` for more detailed\ndocumentation.\n\n\nSimple examples\n---------------\nThe following examples should be enough to understand in which cases `open_iterable()` would be\nuseful and get a high-level understanding of how to use it:\n\nRead bytes from a generator of bytes:\n```python\ngen = generate_bytes()\n\n# adapt the generator to a file-like object in binary mode\n# (fp.read() will return bytes)\nfp = open_iterable(gen, \"rb\")\n\nwhile chunk := fp.read(4096):\n    process_chunk(chunk)\n```\n\nRead lines of text from a generator of bytes:\n```python\ngen = generate_bytes()\n\n# adapt the generator to a file-like object in text mode\n# (fp.read() will return a string, fp.readline is also available)\nfp = open_iterable(gen, \"rt\", encoding=\"utf-8\")\n\nfor line in fp:\n    process_line_of_text(line)\n```\n\n\nTests\n-----\nThis package contains extensive tests. To run them, install `pytest` (`pip install pytest`) and run\n`py.test` in the project directory.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nLicensed under the [GNU LGPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html).\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/pR0Ps/iterable-io","keywords":"","license":"LGPLv3","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"iterable-io","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/iterable-io/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/iterable-io/","project_urls":{"Changelog":"https://github.com/pR0Ps/iterable-io/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md","Homepage":"https://github.com/pR0Ps/iterable-io","Source":"https://github.com/pR0Ps/iterable-io"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/iterable-io/1.0.0/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":">=3.5","summary":"Adapt generators and other iterables to a file-like interface","version":"1.0.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":19597047,"releases":{"1.0.0":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"8d6339881aeeaf0a186fce8a755ec26e76ba61731a89b66e08b9139cec26ff0d","md5":"c87d4f59e271c2e1c6dcef24fa8fa04f","sha256":"509b0e54888d7302d67687739d96014a79d54771723e9b0842a0243b467e6294"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"iterable_io-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"c87d4f59e271c2e1c6dcef24fa8fa04f","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.5","size":4855,"upload_time":"2023-09-03T20:29:14","upload_time_iso_8601":"2023-09-03T20:29:14.562879Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8d/63/39881aeeaf0a186fce8a755ec26e76ba61731a89b66e08b9139cec26ff0d/iterable_io-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"40be27d59b5c1d74ecbd26c1142f84b61d6cb04f0d0337697149645f34406b2d","md5":"d6027af37f8e15edd346bdff6d5c5e3c","sha256":"fb9e1b739587a9ba0d5c60a3e1eb71246761583bc9f18b3c35bb112b44b18c3c"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"iterable-io-1.0.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"d6027af37f8e15edd346bdff6d5c5e3c","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.5","size":6050,"upload_time":"2023-09-03T20:29:16","upload_time_iso_8601":"2023-09-03T20:29:16.215115Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/40/be/27d59b5c1d74ecbd26c1142f84b61d6cb04f0d0337697149645f34406b2d/iterable-io-1.0.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"8d6339881aeeaf0a186fce8a755ec26e76ba61731a89b66e08b9139cec26ff0d","md5":"c87d4f59e271c2e1c6dcef24fa8fa04f","sha256":"509b0e54888d7302d67687739d96014a79d54771723e9b0842a0243b467e6294"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"iterable_io-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"c87d4f59e271c2e1c6dcef24fa8fa04f","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.5","size":4855,"upload_time":"2023-09-03T20:29:14","upload_time_iso_8601":"2023-09-03T20:29:14.562879Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/8d/63/39881aeeaf0a186fce8a755ec26e76ba61731a89b66e08b9139cec26ff0d/iterable_io-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"40be27d59b5c1d74ecbd26c1142f84b61d6cb04f0d0337697149645f34406b2d","md5":"d6027af37f8e15edd346bdff6d5c5e3c","sha256":"fb9e1b739587a9ba0d5c60a3e1eb71246761583bc9f18b3c35bb112b44b18c3c"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"iterable-io-1.0.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"d6027af37f8e15edd346bdff6d5c5e3c","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.5","size":6050,"upload_time":"2023-09-03T20:29:16","upload_time_iso_8601":"2023-09-03T20:29:16.215115Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/40/be/27d59b5c1d74ecbd26c1142f84b61d6cb04f0d0337697149645f34406b2d/iterable-io-1.0.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
