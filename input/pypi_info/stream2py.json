{"info":{"author":"OtoSense","author_email":"","bugtrack_url":null,"classifiers":[],"description":"[Documentation hosted here](https://i2mint.github.io/stream2py/index.html).\n\nTo install: `pip install stream2py`\n\n# stream2py\n\nBring data streams to python, with ease.\n\nOne of the goals of the suite of i2i tools is to get from idea 2 implementation without all the fuss. \nWe've got py2store to do that for the storage (reading or writing) concern, \nand others (e.g. py2cli, py2ws, py2dash) to take care of exposing python functions to the world (of command line interfaces, webservices, browser dashboards, etc.).\n\nHere, we address the stream acquisition concern. \nAs always, we aim at offering as-simple-as-drawing-a-simple-drawing means to get things done. \n\n## Plugins\n\n`stream2py` has the core functionality, and is completely dependency-free (only builtin python). \n\nThat said, to work with specific stream sources, you can install plugins that will allow you to work with them. \nAt the time of writing this we have:\n- Audio: [audiostream2py](https://github.com/i2mint/audiostream2py)\n- Keyboard inputs: [keyboardstream2py](https://github.com/i2mint/keyboardstream2py)\n- PLC (Programmable Logic Controller): [plcstream2py](https://github.com/i2mint/plcstream2py)\n- Computer health stats: [pchealthstream2py](https://github.com/i2mint/pchealthstream2py)\n- Video: [videostream2py](https://github.com/i2mint/videostream2py)\n- Flask: [flaskstream2py](https://github.com/i2mint/flaskstream2py)\n\n\n# What `stream2py` is for\n\n## Reduce vocabulary entropy\n\nOne way we do this is by reducing the vocabulary entropy: \nWe don't want to have to think about how every specific source calls a read, or a size, \nor a time to pause before reads, \nor what format THAT particular sensor is encoding it's data in, \nhaving you shuffle through documentation pages before you can figure out how to start doing \nthe fun stuff, \nwhich happens to be the stuff that actually produces value. And, oh, once you figure it out, \nif you don't use it for a few months or years, next time you need to do something similar, you'll have to figure it all out again.\n\nNo. That's just a waste of time of time. Instead, we say you do that at most once. \nYou don't have to do it at all if the community (us) already provided you with the their-language-to-our-consistent-language adapter for the stream you want to hook into. And if it's something new, well you'll have to figure it out, but you then write the adapter once, and now you (1) can use the rest of stream2py's tools and (2) you don't have to do it again.\n\n## Go back in time\n\nWe also address the problem of impermanence. \n\nThink of the streams that different sensors such as audio, vibration, video offer, or even \"industrial\" signals such as wifi, can bus data, PLC, etc. They happen, and they're gone. Sure, they usually have buffers, but these are typically just big enough to get the data from high frequency reads -- not enough to have the time for some more involved analysis that smart systems require. \n\nWe address this problem by \n\n## Multi readers\n\nIt often happens that you want to do more than one thing with a stream. \nSay store it, visualize it in real time, and direct it to a analysis pipeline. \nIn order for this to be possible with no hiccups, some things need to be taken care of. \nWe did, so you don't have to.\n\n## Timestamp correctly\n\nIn our extensive experience with people (the write code to store stream data), \nwe've noticed that many engineers, when faced with the task to timestamp the segments of \nstream that they're saving, follow a design pattern that goes like this\n(a) get the stream data\n(b) ask the system what date/time it is\n(c) use that (and perhaps, just to make even more likely for the timestamp to be interpreted \nincorrectly, call it the \"offset_date\")\n\nThe problem with this design pattern is that it's all pattern and no design. \nIt is **not** the timestamp of the beginning of the segment: \nThat time happened **after** the **end** of the event of the end of the segment occurred, \nand even more so, **after** the system that will timestamp and store. \nFurther, there is a lot of wiggle room in the delay accumulated between the actual event, \nand the moment we ask the system what time it is. \nSometimes it doesn't matter, but sometimes it does: \nFor example, if we want to align with some other timestamped data, \nor use these timestamps to determine if there's gaps or overlaps between the segments \nwe've acquired.\n\nPoint is, stream2py will give you the tools to tackle that problem properly. \nIt does so by having the stream2py buffers mentioned above keep data flow statistics that readers can then use to \nmore precisely timestamp what they read.\n\n[Documentation
