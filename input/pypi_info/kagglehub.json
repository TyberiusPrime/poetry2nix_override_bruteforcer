You can sign up [here](https://www.kaggle.com/account/login).\n\nAfter login, you can download your Kaggle API credentials at https://www.kaggle.com/settings by clicking on the \"Create New Token\" button under the \"API\" section.\n\nYou have 3 different options to authenticate.\n\n#### Option 1: Calling kagglehub.login()\n\nThis will prompt you to enter your username and token:\n\n```python\nimport kagglehub\n\nkagglehub.login()\n```\n\n#### Option 2: Read credentials from environment variables\n\nYou can also choose to export your Kaggle username and token to the environment:\n\n```sh\nexport KAGGLE_USERNAME=datadinosaur\nexport KAGGLE_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n```\n\n#### Option 3: Read credentials from `kaggle.json`\n\nStore your `kaggle.json` credentials file at `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`.\n\nAlternatively, you can set the `KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable to change this location to `$KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR/kaggle.json`.\n\nNote for Windows users: The default directory is `%HOMEPATH%/kaggle.json`.\n\n### Download Model\n\nThe following examples download the `answer-equivalence-bem` variation of this Kaggle model: https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/bert/tensorFlow2/answer-equivalence-bem\n\n```python\nimport kagglehub\n\n# Download the latest version.\nkagglehub.model_download('google/bert/tensorFlow2/answer-equivalence-bem')\n\n# Download a specific version.\nkagglehub.model_download('google/bert/tensorFlow2/answer-equivalence-bem/1')\n\n# Download a single file.\nkagglehub.model_download('google/bert/tensorFlow2/answer-equivalence-bem', path='variables/variables.index')\n\n# Download a model or file, even if previously downloaded to cache. Only available outside Kaggle notebooks.\nkagglehub.model_download('google/bert/tensorFlow2/answer-equivalence-bem', force_download=True)\n```\n\n### Upload Model\nUploads a new variation (or a new variation's version if it already exists).\n\n```python\nimport kagglehub\n\n# For example, to upload a new variation to this model:\n# - https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/bert/tensorFlow2/answer-equivalence-bem\n# \n# You would use the following handle: `google/bert/tensorFlow2/answer-equivalence-bem`\nhandle = '<KAGGLE_USERNAME>/<MODEL>/<FRAMEWORK>/<VARIATION>'\nlocal_model_dir = 'path/to/local/model/dir'\n\nkagglehub.model_upload(handle, local_model_dir)\n\n# You can also specify some version notes (optional)\nkagglehub.model_upload(handle, local_model_dir, version_notes='improved accuracy')\n\n# You can also specify a license (optional)\nkagglehub.model_upload(handle, local_model_dir, license_name='Apache 2.0')\n```\n\n## Development\n\n### Prequisites\n\nWe use [hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io) to manage this project.\n\nFollow these [instructions](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/) to install it.\n\n### Tests\n\n```sh\n# Run all tests\nhatch run test\n\n# Run a single test file\nhatch run test tests/test_<SOME_FILE>.py\n```\n\n### Integration Tests\n\nTo run integration tests on your local machine, you need to set up your Kaggle API credentials. You can do this in one of these two ways described in the earlier sections of this document. Refer to the sections: \n- [Using environment variables](#option-2-read-credentials-from-environment-variables)\n- [Using credentials file](#option-3-read-credentials-from-kagglejson)\n\nAfter setting up your credentials by any of these methods, you can run the integration tests as follows:\n\n```sh\n# Run all tests\nhatch run integration-test\n```\n\n\n### Run `kagglehub` from source\n\n```sh\n# Download a model & print the path\nhatch run python -c \"import kagglehub; print('path: ', kagglehub.model_download('google/bert/tensorFlow2/answer-equivalence-bem'))\"\n```\n\n### Lint / Format\n\n```sh\n# Lint check\nhatch run lint:style\nhatch run lint:typing\nhatch run lint:all     # for both\n\n# Format\nhatch run lint:fmt\n```\n\n### Coverage report\n\n```sh\nhatch cov\n```\n\n### Build\n\n```sh\nhatch build\n```\n\n### Running `hatch` commands inside Docker\n\nThis is useful to run in a consistent environment and easily switch between Python versions.\n\nThe following shows how to run `hatch run lint:all` but this also works for any other hatch commands:\n\n```\n# Use default Python version\n./docker-hatch run lint:all\n\n# Use specific Python version (Must be a valid tag from: https://hub.docker.com/_/python)\n./docker-hatch -v 3.9 run lint:all\n```\n\n## VS Code setup\n\n### Prerequisites\nInstall the recommended extensions.\n\n### Instructions\n\nConfigure hatch to create virtual env in project folder.\n```\nhatch config set dirs.env.virtual .env\n```\n\nAfter, create all the python environments needed by running `hatch -e all run tests`.\n\nFinally, configure vscode to use one of the selected environments:\n`cmd + shift + p` -> `python: Select Interpreter` -> Pick one of the folders in `./.env`\n\n## Support\n\nThe kagglehub library has configured automatic logging which is stored in a log folder. The log destination is resolved via the [os.path.expanduser](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.path.html#os.path.expanduser)\n\nThe table below contains possible locations:\n| os      | log path                                         |\n|---------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| osx     | /user/$USERNAME/.kaggle/logs/kagglehub.log       |\n| linux   | ~/.kaggle/logs/kagglehub.log                     |\n| windows | C:\\Users\\\\%USERNAME%\\\\.kaggle\\logs\\kagglehub.log |\n\nPlease include the log to help troubleshoot issues.\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":null,"downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":null,"keywords":"API, Kaggle","license":"Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004 http://www.apache.org/licenses/  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION  1.
