This is a value that is neither True nor False, but rather may be one of those values. With cooleans, you can more accurately represent situations where the truth value of a statement is uncertain or unknown.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nYou can install cooleans using pip:  \r\n`pip install cooleans`\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nHere's an example of how to use cooleans in Python:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom cooleans import DefinitelyTrue, DefinitelyFalse, Perhaps\r\n\r\nmy_bool = DefinitelyTrue\r\nif my_bool:\r\n    print(\"This is definitely true\")\r\n\r\nmy_bool = Perhaps\r\nif my_bool >= Perhaps:\r\n    print(\"This might be true\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, we create a `DefinitelyTrue` coolean value and use it in an if statement to print \"This is definitely true\". We then create a Perhaps coolean value and use it in an if statement to print \"This might be true\". Note that Perhaps will always have a truth value of False when treated as a bool.  \r\n\r\n### Supported Operators\r\n\r\nCooleans support the same logical operators as normal bools in Python, including:\r\n\r\n- `and`\r\n- `or`\r\n- `not`\r\n- `==`\r\n- `!=`\r\n- `<`\r\n- `>`\r\n- `<=`\r\n- `>=`\r\n\r\n### Using Values Directly\r\n\r\nCooleans can be used directly as values since they are implemented as a Python class, like so:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom cooleans import DefinitelyTrue, DefinitelyFalse, Perhaps\r\n\r\nprint(DefinitelyTrue and DefinitelyFalse)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code snippet will output DefinitelyFalse.  \r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nWe don't welcome contributions to cooleans yet.  \r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE file for details.  \r\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"","keywords":"type bool booleans perhaps","license":"","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"cooleans","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/cooleans/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/cooleans/","project_urls":null,"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/cooleans/0.2.0/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":">=3.6","summary":"Better than booleans","version":"0.2.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":21403141,"releases":{"0.2.0":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"abae1ec6dc6f8798a6ad3a44adb02ea8bd870bd60918eb73db6f7b72bf117caf","md5":"105de777212f403f5c74c69f7edbe6ed","sha256":"a56eae25e0834c08d290b53ddc99440aac8ffa1bfc0332407d5b96b8ee1eb0b7"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"cooleans-0.2.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"105de777212f403f5c74c69f7edbe6ed","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.6","size":1826,"upload_time":"2024-01-12T14:05:25","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-01-12T14:05:25.525775Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ab/ae/1ec6dc6f8798a6ad3a44adb02ea8bd870bd60918eb73db6f7b72bf117caf/cooleans-0.2.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"abae1ec6dc6f8798a6ad3a44adb02ea8bd870bd60918eb73db6f7b72bf117caf","md5":"105de777212f403f5c74c69f7edbe6ed","sha256":"a56eae25e0834c08d290b53ddc99440aac8ffa1bfc0332407d5b96b8ee1eb0b7"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"cooleans-0.2.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"105de777212f403f5c74c69f7edbe6ed","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.6","size":1826,"upload_time":"2024-01-12T14:05:25","upload_time_iso_8601":"2024-01-12T14:05:25.525775Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ab/ae/1ec6dc6f8798a6ad3a44adb02ea8bd870bd60918eb73db6f7b72bf117caf/cooleans-0.2.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
