These 'directory' URLs cannot currently be directly accessed, but files within the directory are publicly accessible. These URLs can also be provided to the training script to resume training from the checkpoint (see [Training](#training)). Each checkpoint directory consists of:\n\n- `config.yaml`: the config at that training step.\n- `model.pt`, `optim.pt`, `train.pt`: model, optimizer and training state at that training step.\n\nDetails about the other types of OLMo checkpoints (including OLMo HF Transformers checkpoints) can be found in [Checkpoints.md](https://github.com/allenai/OLMo/blob/main/docs/Checkpoints.md).\n\n## Inference\n\nYou can utilize our Hugging Face integration to run inference on the OLMo Transformers checkpoints:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nolmo = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"allenai/OLMo-1.7-7B-hf\")\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"allenai/OLMo-1.7-7B-hf\")\n\nmessage = [\"Language modeling is \"]\ninputs = tokenizer(message, return_tensors='pt', return_token_type_ids=False)\nresponse = olmo.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=100, do_sample=True, top_k=50, top_p=0.95)\nprint(tokenizer.batch_decode(response, skip_special_tokens=True)[0])\n```\n\nAlternatively, with the Hugging Face pipeline abstraction:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nolmo_pipe = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=\"allenai/OLMo-1.7-7B-hf\")\nprint(olmo_pipe(\"Language modeling is\"))\n```\n\n### Inference on finetuned checkpoints\n\nIf you finetune the model using the code in [Fine-tuning](#fine-tuning), you can use the conversion script to convert a native OLMo checkpoint to a Hugging Face-compatible checkpoint.\n\n```bash\npython scripts/convert_olmo_to_hf_new.py --input_dir /path/to/olmo/checkpoint --output_dir /path/to/hf/checkpoint/ --tokenizer_json_path tokenizers/allenai_gpt-neox-olmo-dolma-v1_5.json\n```\n\n### Quantization\n\n```python\nolmo = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"allenai/OLMo-1.7-7B-hf\", torch_dtype=torch.float16, load_in_8bit=True)  # requires bitsandbytes\n```\n\nThe quantized model is more sensitive to typing / cuda, so it is recommended to pass the inputs as inputs.input_ids.to('cuda') to avoid potential issues.\n\n## Reproducibility\n\n### Training\n\nThe configs used to train the official OLMo models are provided in the [`configs/official/`](https://github.com/allenai/OLMo/blob/main/configs/official) directory.\n\nNote that while the training and validation data is public and free to download, the paths to the data within those configs are pointed at a CloudFlare R2 bucket, which requires an API key for programmatic access.\nSo in order to use any of these configs to reproduce a training run you'll first have to download the corresponding data to a location of your choosing and then update the paths in the config accordingly.\n\nYou can derive the public HTTP URL from an R2 URL by replacing `r2://olmo-data` with `https://olmo-data.org`.\nFor example, if the R2 data URL is:\n\n`r2://olmo-data/preprocessed/olmo-mix/v1_5/gpt-neox-20b-pii-special/part-000-00000.npy`\n\nthen the corresponding public URL is:\n\n`https://olmo-data.org/preprocessed/olmo-mix/v1_5/gpt-neox-20b-pii-special/part-000-00000.npy`\n\nOnce you've updated the data paths in the config you can launch a training run via `torchrun`. For example, to launch the 1B model training on a single 8x GPU node, you would run:\n\n```bash\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=8 scripts/train.py configs/official/OLMo-1B.yaml\n```\n\nYou can use the same method to launch multi-node jobs as well. See [the documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html) for `torchrun` to understand the additional arguments you'll need to configure the rendezvous backend / endpoint.\n\nTo resume training from a checkpoint, you can pass its path (local or URL)\nto `scripts/train.py` with the `--load_path` arguments. For example, to resume training from step 1000 of the OLMo 1B run:\n\n```bash\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=8 scripts/train.py configs/official/OLMo-1B.yaml --load_path https://olmo-checkpoints.org/ai2-llm/olmo-small/w1r5xfzt/step1000-unsharded\n```\n\n### Inspecting training data\n\nYou may be interested in inspecting the exact tokens that composed a particular batch during the training of one of the OLMo models.\nWe provide tools to do this, but first you'll need to download the data as above (unless you have an R2 API key) and update the corresponding config accordingly.\n\nThen take note of the URL of the data order file you want, which can be found in the [Models Overview](#models-overview) table. For example, the data order file for the first epoch of the OLMo-7B model is [https://olmo-checkpoints.org/ai2-llm/olmo-medium/wvc30anm/train_data/global_indices.npy](https://olmo-checkpoints.org/ai2-llm/olmo-small/46zc5fly/train_data/global_indices.npy).\n\nOnce you have that you can use this snippet to inspect the data within a particular batch:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom cached_path import cached_path\n\nfrom olmo.config import TrainConfig\nfrom olmo.data import build_memmap_dataset\n\n# Update these paths to what you want:\ndata_order_file_path = cached_path(\"https://olmo-checkpoints.org/ai2-llm/olmo-medium/wvc30anm/train_data/global_indices.npy\")\ntrain_config_path = \"configs/official/OLMo-7B.yaml\"\n\n\ncfg = TrainConfig.load(train_config_path)\ndataset = build_memmap_dataset(cfg, cfg.data)\nbatch_size = cfg.global_train_batch_size\nglobal_indices = np.memmap(data_order_file_path, mode=\"r+\", dtype=np.uint32)\n\n\ndef get_batch_instances(batch_idx: int) -> list[list[int]]:\n    batch_start = batch_idx * batch_size\n    batch_end = (batch_idx + 1) * batch_size\n    batch_indices = global_indices[batch_start:batch_end]\n    batch_instances = []\n    for index in batch_indices:\n        token_ids = dataset[index][\"input_ids\"].tolist()\n        batch_instances.append(token_ids)\n    return batch_instances\n\n\n# Get all 2048 x 2048 token IDs in the first batch.\nget_batch_instances(0)\n```\n\n\n## Fine-tuning\n\nTo fine-tune an OLMo model using our trainer you'll first need to prepare your dataset by tokenizing it and saving the tokens IDs to a flat numpy memory-mapped array. See [`scripts/prepare_tulu_data.py`](./scripts/prepare_tulu_data.py) for an example with the Tulu V2 dataset, which can be easily modified for other datasets.\n\nNext, prepare your training config. There are many examples in the [`configs/`](https://github.com/allenai/OLMo/blob/main/configs) directory that you can use as a starting point. The most important thing is to make sure the model parameters (the `model` field in the config) match up with the checkpoint you're starting from. To be safe you can always start from the config that comes with the model checkpoint. At a minimum you'll need to make the following changes to the config or provide the corresponding overrides from the command line:\n\n- Update `load_path` to point to the checkpoint you want to start from.\n- Set `reset_trainer_state` to `true`.\n- Update `data.paths` to point to the `token_ids.npy` file you generated.\n- Optionally update `data.label_mask_paths` to point to the `label_mask.npy` file you generated, unless you don't need special masking for the loss.\n- Update `evaluators` to add/remove in-loop evaluations.\n\nOnce you're satisfied with your training config, you can launch the training job via `torchrun`. For example:\n\n```\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node=8 scripts/train.py {path_to_train_config} \\\n    --data.paths=[{path_to_data}/input_ids.npy] \\\n    --data.label_mask_paths=[{path_to_data}/label_mask.npy] \\\n    --load_path={path_to_checkpoint} \\\n    --reset_trainer_state\n```\n\nNote: passing CLI overrides like `--reset_trainer_state` is only necessary if you didn't update those fields in your config.\n\n## Evaluation\n\nAdditional tools for evaluating OLMo models are available at the [OLMo Eval](https://github.com/allenai/ai2-olmo-eval) repo.\n\n## Citing\n\n```bibtex\n@article{OLMo,\n  title={OLMo: Accelerating the Science of Language Models},\n  author={Dirk Groeneveld and Iz Beltagy and Pete Walsh and Akshita Bhagia and Rodney Kinney and Oyvind Tafjord and A.
