Idle time limiting makes the recordings much more interesting to\nwatch. Try it.\n\nIf you want to watch and share it on the web, upload it:\n\n```sh\nasciinema upload first.cast\n```\n\nThe above uploads it to [asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org), which is a\ndefault [asciinema-server](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server)\ninstance, and prints a secret link you can use to watch your recording in a web\nbrowser.\n\nYou can record and upload in one step by omitting the filename:\n\n```sh\nasciinema rec\n```\n\nYou'll be asked to confirm the upload when the recording is done. Nothing is\nsent anywhere without your consent.\n\nThese are the basics, but there's much more you can do. The following sections\ncover installation, usage and hosting of the recordings in more detail. Also,\ncheckout [agg](https://github.com/asciinema/agg) if you're interested in GIF generation.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Python package from PyPI\n\n[pypi]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/asciinema\n\nasciinema is available on [PyPI] and can be installed with\n[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) (if you have it) or with pip (Python 3\nwith setuptools required):\n\n```sh\npipx install asciinema\n```\n\nOr with pip (using your preferred Python version):\n\n```sh\npython3 -m pip install asciinema\n```\n\nInstalling from [PyPI] is the recommended way of installation, which gives you the latest released version.\n\n### Native packages\n\nasciinema is included in repositories of most popular package managers on Mac OS\nX, Linux and FreeBSD. Look for package named `asciinema`. See the\n[list of available packages](https://asciinema.org/docs/installation).\n\n### Running latest version from source code checkout\n\nIf you can't use Python package or native package for your OS is outdated you\ncan clone the repo and run asciinema straight from the checkout.\n\nClone the repo:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema.git\ncd asciinema\n```\n\nIf you want latest stable version:\n\n```sh\ngit checkout master\n```\n\nIf you want current development version:\n\n```sh\ngit checkout develop\n```\n\nThen run it with:\n\n```sh\npython3 -m asciinema --version\n```\n\n### Docker image\n\nasciinema Docker image is based on [Ubuntu\n22.04](https://releases.ubuntu.com/22.04/) and has the latest version of\nasciinema recorder pre-installed.\n\n```sh\ndocker pull ghcr.io/asciinema/asciinema\n```\n\nWhen running it don't forget to allocate a pseudo-TTY (`-t`), keep STDIN open\n(`-i`) and mount config directory volume (`-v`):\n\n```sh\ndocker run --rm -it -v \"${HOME}/.config/asciinema:/root/.config/asciinema\" ghcr.io/asciinema/asciinema rec\n```\n\nContainer's entrypoint is set to `/usr/local/bin/asciinema` so you can run the\ncontainer with any arguments you would normally pass to `asciinema` binary (see\nUsage section for commands and options).\n\nThere's not much software installed in this image though. In most cases you may\nwant to install extra programs before recording. One option is to derive new\nimage from this one (start your custom Dockerfile with `FROM\nghcr.io/asciinema/asciinema`). Another option is to start the container with\n`/bin/bash` as the entrypoint, install extra packages and manually start\n`asciinema rec`:\n\n```console\ndocker run --rm -it -v \"${HOME}/.config/asciinema:/root/.config/asciinema\" --entrypoint=/bin/bash ghcr.io/asciinema/asciinema rec\nroot@6689517d99a1:~# apt-get install foobar\nroot@6689517d99a1:~# asciinema rec\n```\n\nIt is also possible to run the docker container as a non-root user, which has\nsecurity benefits. You can specify a user and group id at runtime to give the\napplication permission similar to the calling user on your host.\n\n```sh\ndocker run --rm -it \\\n    --env=ASCIINEMA_CONFIG_HOME=\"/run/user/$(id -u)/.config/asciinema\" \\\n    --user=\"$(id -u):$(id -g)\" \\\n    --volume=\"${HOME}/.config/asciinema:/run/user/$(id -u)/.config/asciinema:rw\" \\\n    --volume=\"${PWD}:/data:rw\" \\\n    --workdir='/data' \\\n    ghcr.io/asciinema/asciinema rec\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nasciinema is composed of multiple commands, similar to `git`, `apt-get` or\n`brew`.\n\nWhen you run `asciinema` with no arguments help message is displayed, listing\nall available commands with their options.\n\n### `rec [filename]`\n\n**Record terminal session.**\n\nBy running `asciinema rec [filename]` you start a new recording session. The\ncommand (process) that is recorded can be specified with `-c` option (see\nbelow), and defaults to `$SHELL` which is what you want in most cases.\n\nYou can temporarily pause the capture of your terminal by pressing\n<kbd>Ctrl+\\\\</kbd>.  This is useful when you want to execute some commands during\nthe recording session that should not be captured (e.g. pasting secrets). Resume\nby pressing <kbd>Ctrl+\\\\</kbd> again. When pausing desktop notification is\ndisplayed so you're sure the sensitive output won't be captured in the\nrecording.\n\nRecording finishes when you exit the shell (hit <kbd>Ctrl+D</kbd> or type\n`exit`). If the recorded process is not a shell then recording finishes when\nthe process exits.\n\nIf the `filename` argument is omitted then (after asking for confirmation) the\nresulting asciicast is uploaded to\n[asciinema-server](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server) (by default to\nasciinema.org), where it can be watched and shared.\n\nIf the `filename` argument is given then the resulting recording (called\n[asciicast](doc/asciicast-v2.md)) is saved to a local file. It can later be\nreplayed with `asciinema play <filename>` and/or uploaded to asciinema server\nwith `asciinema upload <filename>`.\n\n`ASCIINEMA_REC=1` is added to recorded process environment variables. This\ncan be used by your shell's config file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) to alter the\nprompt or play a sound when the shell is being recorded.\n\nAvailable options:\n\n- `--stdin` - Enable stdin (keyboard) recording (see below)\n- `--append` - Append to existing recording\n- `--raw` - Save raw STDOUT output, without timing information or other metadata\n- `--overwrite` - Overwrite the recording if it already exists\n- `-c, --command=<command>` - Specify command to record, defaults to $SHELL\n- `-e, --env=<var-names>` - List of environment variables to capture, defaults\n  to `SHELL,TERM`\n- `-t, --title=<title>` - Specify the title of the asciicast\n- `-i, --idle-time-limit=<sec>` - Limit recorded terminal inactivity to max `<sec>` seconds\n- `--cols=<n>` - Override terminal columns for recorded process\n- `--rows=<n>` - Override terminal rows for recorded process\n- `-y, --yes` - Answer \"yes\" to all prompts (e.g. upload confirmation)\n- `-q, --quiet` - Be quiet, suppress all notices/warnings (implies -y)\n\nStdin recording allows for capturing of all characters typed in by the user in\nthe currently recorded shell. This may be used by a player (e.g.\n[asciinema-player](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player)) to display\npressed keys. Because it's basically key-logging (scoped to a single shell\ninstance), it's disabled by default, and has to be explicitly enabled via\n`--stdin` option.\n\n### `play <filename>`\n\n**Replay recorded asciicast in a terminal.**\n\nThis command replays given asciicast (as recorded by `rec` command) directly in\nyour terminal.\n\nFollowing keyboard shortcuts are available by default:\n\n- <kbd>Space</kbd> - toggle pause,\n- <kbd>.</kbd> - step through a recording a frame at a time (when paused),\n- <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> - exit.\n\nSee \"Configuration file\" section for information on how to customize the\nkeyboard shortcuts.\n\nPlaying from a local file:\n\n```sh\nasciinema play /path/to/asciicast.cast\n```\n\nPlaying from HTTP(S) URL:\n\n```sh\nasciinema play https://asciinema.org/a/22124.cast\nasciinema play http://example.com/demo.cast\n```\n\nPlaying from asciicast page URL (requires `<link rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application/x-asciicast\" href=\"/my/ascii.cast\">` in page's HTML):\n\n```sh\nasciinema play https://asciinema.org/a/22124\nasciinema play http://example.com/blog/post.html\n```\n\nPlaying from stdin:\n\n```sh\ncat /path/to/asciicast.cast | asciinema play -\nssh user@host cat asciicast.cast | asciinema play -\n```\n\nPlaying from IPFS:\n\n```sh\nasciinema play dweb:/ipfs/QmNe7FsYaHc9SaDEAEXbaagAzNw9cH7YbzN4xV7jV1MCzK/ascii.cast\n```\n\nAvailable options:\n\n- `-i, --idle-time-limit=<sec>` - Limit replayed terminal inactivity to max `<sec>` seconds\n- `-s, --speed=<factor>` - Playback speed (can be fractional)\n- `-l, --loop` - Play in a loop\n- `-m, --pause-on-markers` - Automatically pause on [markers](#markers)\n- `--stream=<stream>` - Select stream to play (see below)\n- `--out-fmt=<format>` - Select output format (see below)\n\nBy default the output stream (`o`) is played. This is what you want in most\ncases.  If you recorded the input stream (`i`) with `asciinema rec --stdin` then\nyou can replay it with `asciinema play --stream=i <filename>`.\n\nBy default the selected stream is written to stdout in original, raw data form.\nThis is also what you want in majority of cases. However you can change the\noutput format to asciicast (newline delimited JSON) with `asciinema play\n--out-fmt=asciicast <filename>`. This allows delegating actual rendering to\nanother place (e.g. outside of your terminal) by piping output of `asciinema\nplay` to a tool of your choice.\n\n> For the best playback experience it is recommended to run `asciinema play` in\n> a terminal of dimensions not smaller than the one used for recording, as\n> there's no \"transcoding\" of control sequences for new terminal size.\n\n### `cat <filename>`\n\n**Print full output of recorded asciicast to a terminal.**\n\nWhile `asciinema play <filename>` replays the recorded session using timing\ninformation saved in the asciicast, `asciinema cat <filename>` dumps the full\noutput (including all escape sequences) to a terminal immediately.\n\n`asciinema cat existing.cast >output.txt` gives the same result as recording via\n`asciinema rec --raw output.txt`.\n\n### `upload <filename>`\n\n**Upload recorded asciicast to asciinema.org site.**\n\nThis command uploads given asciicast (recorded by `rec` command) to\nasciinema.org, where it can be watched and shared.\n\n`asciinema rec demo.cast` + `asciinema play demo.cast` + `asciinema upload demo.cast` is a nice combo if you want to review an asciicast before\npublishing it on asciinema.org.\n\n### `auth`\n\n**Link your install ID with your asciinema.org user account.**\n\nIf you want to manage your recordings (change title/theme, delete) at\nasciinema.org you need to link your \"install ID\" with asciinema.org user\naccount.\n\nThis command displays the URL to open in a web browser to do that. You may be\nasked to log in first.\n\nInstall ID is a random ID ([UUID\nv4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)) generated\nlocally when you run asciinema for the first time, and saved at\n`$HOME/.config/asciinema/install-id`. Its purpose is to connect local machine\nwith uploaded recordings, so they can later be associated with asciinema.org\naccount. This way we decouple uploading from account creation, allowing them to\nhappen in any order.\n\n> A new install ID is generated on each machine and system user account you use\n> asciinema on, so in order to keep all recordings under a single asciinema.org\n> account you need to run `asciinema auth` on all of those machines.\n\n> asciinema versions prior to 2.0 confusingly referred to install ID as \"API\n> token\".\n\n## Markers\n\nMarkers allow marking specific time locations in a recording, which can be used\nfor navigation, as well as for automatic pausing of the playback.\n\nMarkers can be added to a recording in several ways:\n\n- while you are recording, by pressing a configured hotkey, see [add_marker_key\n  config option](#configuration-file)\n- for existing recording, by inserting marker events (`\"m\"`) in the asciicast\n  file, see [marker event](doc/asciicast-v2.md#m---marker)\n\nWhen replaying a recording with `asciinema play` you can enable\nauto-pause-on-marker behaviour with `-m`/`--pause-on-markers` option (it's off\nby default). When a marker is encountered, the playback automatically pauses and\ncan be resumed by pressing space bar key. The playback continues until next\nmarker is encountered. You can also fast-forward to the next marker by pressing\n`]` key (when paused).\n\nMarkers can be useful in e.g. live demos: you can create a recording with\nmarkers, then play it back during presentation, and have it stop wherever you\nwant to explain terminal contents in more detail.\n\n## Hosting the recordings on the web\n\nAs mentioned in the `Usage > rec` section above, if the `filename` argument to\n`asciinema rec` is omitted then the recorded asciicast is uploaded to\n[asciinema.org](https://asciinema.org). You can watch it there and share it via\nsecret URL.\n\nIf you prefer to host the recordings yourself, you can do so by either:\n\n- recording to a file (`asciinema rec demo.cast`), and using [asciinema's\n  standalone web\n  player](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-player#self-hosting-quick-start)\n  in your HTML page, or\n- setting up your own\n  [asciinema-server](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server) instance,\n  and [setting API URL\n  accordingly](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema-server/wiki/Installation-guide#using-asciinema-recorder-with-your-instance).\n\n## Configuration file\n\nYou can configure asciinema by creating config file at\n`$HOME/.config/asciinema/config`.\n\nConfiguration is split into sections (`[api]`, `[record]`, `[play]`). Here's a\nlist of all available options for each section:\n\n```ini\n[api]\n\n; API server URL, default: https://asciinema.org\n; If you run your own instance of asciinema-server then set its address here\n; It can also be overriden by setting ASCIINEMA_API_URL environment variable\nurl = https://asciinema.example.com\n\n[record]\n\n; Command to record, default: $SHELL\ncommand = /bin/bash -l\n\n; Enable stdin (keyboard) recording, default: no\nstdin = yes\n\n; List of environment variables to capture, default: SHELL,TERM\nenv = SHELL,TERM,USER\n\n; Limit recorded terminal inactivity to max n seconds, default: off\nidle_time_limit = 2\n\n; Answer \"yes\" to all interactive prompts, default: no\nyes = true\n\n; Be quiet, suppress all notices/warnings, default: no\nquiet = true\n\n; Define hotkey for pausing recording (suspending capture of output),\n; default: C-\\ (control + backslash)\npause_key = C-p\n\n; Define hotkey for adding a marker, default: none\nadd_marker_key = C-x\n\n; Define hotkey prefix key - when defined other recording hotkeys must\n; be preceeded by it, default: no prefix\nprefix_key = C-a\n\n[play]\n\n; Playback speed (can be fractional), default: 1\nspeed = 2\n\n; Limit replayed terminal inactivity to max n seconds, default: off\nidle_time_limit = 1\n\n; Define hotkey for pausing/resuming playback,\n; default: space\npause_key = p\n\n; Define hotkey for stepping through playback, a frame at a time,\n; default: . (dot)\nstep_key = s\n\n; Define hotkey for jumping to the next marker,\n; default: ]\nnext_marker_key = m\n\n[notifications]\n; Desktop notifications are displayed on certain occasions, e.g. when\n; pausing/resuming the capture of terminal with C-\\ keyboard shortcut.\n\n; Should desktop notifications be enabled, default: yes\nenabled = no\n\n; Custom notification command\n; asciinema automatically detects available desktop notification system\n; (notify-send on GNU/Linux, osacript/terminal-notifier on macOS). Custom\n; command can be used if needed.\n; When invoked, environment variable $TEXT contains notification text, while\n; $ICON_PATH contains path to the asciinema logo image.\ncommand = tmux display-message \"$TEXT\"\n```\n\nA very minimal config file could look like that:\n\n```ini\n[record]\nidle_time_limit = 2\n```\n\nConfig directory location can be changed by setting `$ASCIINEMA_CONFIG_HOME`\nenvironment variable.\n\nIf `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set on Linux then asciinema uses\n`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/asciinema` instead of `$HOME/.config/asciinema`.\n\n> asciinema versions prior to 1.1 used `$HOME/.asciinema`. If you have it\n> there you should `mv $HOME/.asciinema $HOME/.config/asciinema`.\n\n## Sponsors\n\nasciinema is sponsored by:\n\n- [**Dashcam**](https://dashcam.io?utm_source=asciinemagithub)\n- [Brightbox](https://www.brightbox.com/)\n\n## Consulting\n\nI offer consulting services for asciinema project.
