It's an out of the box solution that works without\nmodification for most of your use cases.  And should you find\nsomething that Singing & Dancing can't do, it's built to be easily\nextended via plug-ins using the Zope 3 Component Architecture.\n\nFeatures\n========\n\nModern and extensible\n  Singing & Dancing builds on the latest and greatest efforts in the\n  Zope and Plone world.  It makes heavy use of the excellent\n  ``z3c.form`` library and the Zope 3 Component Architecture.  This\n  allows you to easily plug in and extend Singing & Dancing to fit\n  your needs.\n\nWell tested\n  An extensive suite of automated tests make Singing & Dancing\n  exceptionally stable and reliable.  We currently have 200+ tests.\n  Singing & Dancing is not gonna leave you in the lurch!\n\nFully managable through the Plone interface\n  Singing & Dancing is fully usable out of the box.  An extensive\n  set of forms reachable through the configuration panel let you as\n  the user configure many details of your newsletters, like *when*\n  they're sent (periodically or manually), *what* is sent (through the\n  use of the *Smart Folder* interface, or manually), and to whom.\n\nSubscriptions\n  Singing & Dancing uses *confirmed subscription*, i.e. subscribers\n  receive an e-mail to confirm their subscription.  Users can\n  subscribe via a standard subscription form that lists all available\n  newsletters in the site, or through individual subscription forms,\n  e.g. in portlets.\n\nPersonalisation\n  Singing & Dancing allows a channel to define optional collectors\n  or *sections* which a user can optional subscribe to. Scheduled\n  daily or weekly newsletters can then include additional content\n  personalised to those segments of the channel.\n\nExternal subscriber database\n  Optionally instead of using the builtin subscriber database and\n  subscription forms you can use another product such as Plomino of\n  PloneFormGen. Configure a path to a script to list the subscribers\n  is is all that is needed to intergrate S&D with your external\n  subscriber database.\n\nAutomatic sending\n  Any Plone content item can be sent at a scheduled time using the\n  \"Send as newsletter\" feature. These can be sent to the whole\n  subscriber list or to a specific section.\n  Content rules can be configured to send an item as a newsletter\n  immediately under certain conditions including if it matches a\n  of Singing & Dancing's *collection* based *collector*.\n\n.. image:: http://danielnouri.org/media/singing-dancing.jpg\n   :alt: Singing & Dancing Logo by Giuseppe Zizza\n\nUser Manual\n===========\n\nThe Singing & Dancing user manual is available here:\nhttp://www.webtide.co.za/how-to/singing-dancing-user-manual\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nInstallation of Singing & Dancing uses buildout_.  If you don't know\nwhat buildout is or `how to create a buildout`_, `follow this\ntutorial`_ first.\n\nThese instructions assume that you already have a Plone buildout that's built\nand ready to run.\n\nSinging & Dancing is available as `Python eggs on PyPI`_.\n\nTo install Singing & Dancing, add it to your buildout by following\nthese steps:\n\n* Plone 3.x\n\n  1) Edit your ``buildout.cfg`` file and look for the ``[buildout]``\n     section.  Add an ``extends =`` option in that section like the\n     following::\n\n         [buildout]\n         extends = https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.dancing/buildout-extends/0.9.0.cfg\n         parts =\n             zope2\n             ...\n\n         Should you already have an ``extends =`` line, add the new line at\n         the end of the other extends files.  For Plone 3.2.2, your\n         ``[buildout]`` section might start like this::\n\n         [buildout]\n         extends =\n             http://dist.plone.org/release/3.2.2/versions.cfg\n             https://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/collective.dancing/buildout-extends/0.9.0.cfg\n         parts =\n             zope2\n             ...\n\n  2) Next, you'll need to add ``collective.dancing`` to the ``eggs`` and\n     ``zcml`` options in your ``[instance]`` section.  Which should then look\n     like this::\n\n         [instance]\n         ...\n         eggs =\n             ${buildout:eggs}\n             ...\n             collective.dancing\n         zcml =\n             ...\n             collective.dancing\n\n     Note: When you are using Plone > 3.3 you can skipt the zcml part, because\n     ``z3c.autoinclude`` is shipped with Plone 3.3.x by default.\n\n\n  3) Remove all ``additional-fake-eggs`` and ``skip-fake-eggs`` options\n     from your ``[zope2]`` section, if any.  (This is so you don't\n     overrride the ones defined in the S&D extends file that we added in\n     step 1.)\n\n* Plone 4.x\n\n  1) On Plone 4 you don't need to extend your buildout configuration using\n     `extends=...``. You'll need to add ``collective.dancing`` to the ``eggs``\n     in your ``[instance]`` section.  Which should then look like this::\n\n         [instance]\n         ...\n         eggs =\n             ${buildout:eggs}\n             ...\n             collective.dancing\n\n  2) Please use version pins out of ``versions.cfg`` file which is included in\n     package if you have package conflicts or strange errors.\n\nOnce you're done editing your buildout configuration, don't forget to\nrun your buildout again before you start up Zope::\n\n  $ ./bin/buildout -v\n\nThat's it!  You can now start up your Zope instance, and then install\nSinging & Dancing in your Plone site by visiting the *Add-on Products*\nsite control panel.\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\nShould the above instructions not work for you, `contact us`_.\n\n**NOTE**: If you're upgrading your buildout from an older version\nwhere you included version dependencies of S&D by hand, remove the\n``develop-eggs`` directory inside your buildout and re-run buildout.\n\nHere's a list of the most common stumbling blocks:\n\n   - `ValueError: too many values to unpack <https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/253377>`_\n\n   - `Products/Five/i18n.zcml uses namespace package in configure package directive <https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope2/+bug/228254>`_\n\n   - Should you see ``ImportError: Module\n     zope.app.component.metaconfigure has no global defaultLayer``\n     when starting up, make sure you have\n     ``plone.recipe.zope2install`` >= 2.2.  You may use buildout's\n     ``versions`` feature to tell it which version to use.\n\n   - Since version 0.7.0 of collective.singing we don't support older\n     versions of ``z3c.form`` by default. Radio button and checkbox widget\n     hidden templates are already included in more recent ``z3c.form``\n     versions. ( > 2.3.3 as described here\n     http://pypi.python.org/pypi/z3c.form#id14)\n\n     If you want to use an old version (for example the popular 1.9.0 which was\n     pinned in older buildout-extends files) you have to manually include a\n     zcml file located in ``collective.singing.browser.widgets.zcml`` which\n     registers the missing templates for these widgets::\n\n        <include package=\"collective.singing.browser\" file=\"widgets.zcml\" />\n\n     This fixed https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/620608.\n\nIt's installed.  What's next?\n-----------------------------\n\nYou'll now have an entry in the control panel to *Singing & Dancing*.\nThis will lead you to to the advanced configuration panel of S&D.\n\nNote that there's already a default newsletter set up for your\nconvenience.  You can create a *Mailing-list subscribe portlet* to enable\nyour users to subscribe to this channel, or you can point them to\nhttp://yoursite/portal_newsletters/channels/default-channel/subscribe.html\n\nTo send out a newsletter, go to any portal object, like the Plone\nfront page, and click *Actions -> Send as newsletter*.\n\nThe advanced configuration panel of S&D gives you many more ways to\nsend newsletters, like periodically and from automatically collected\ncontent.\n\nProcessing the message queue\n----------------------------\n\nOne important thing to note is that S&D usually queues messages in its\nown message queue before sending them out.  You might have noticed\nthat when you send out a newsletter, S&D tells you that it queued the\nmessages.\n\nIn a production setup, you would normally process the message queue\nperiodically using the built-in Zope ClockServer_.  While you're\ntesting, you can visit the *Statistics* screen in the S&D advanced\nconfiguration panel and manually clear the queues.  If your mail\nconfiguration in Plone is set up correctly, you should be sending mail\nout now.\n\nTo set up ClockServer to trigger the processing automatically for you,\nadd this stanza to the Zope 2 ``[instance]`` section of your buildout\nconfiguration and rerun ``bin/buildout -v``::\n\n  zope-conf-additional =\n      <clock-server>\n        # plonesite is your plone path\n        method /plonesite/@@dancing.utils/tick_and_dispatch\n        period 300\n        user admin\n        password admin\n        # You need your *real* host here\n        host www.mysite.com\n      </clock-server>\n\nOr, if your site is behind Apache using a Virtual Host,\nthe zope.conf clock server configuration would be ::\n\n  zope-conf-additional =\n      <clock-server>\n        # plonesite is your plone path\n        # www.mysite.com your site url\n        method /VirtualHostBase/http/www.mysite.com:80/plonesite/VirtualHostRoot/@@dancing.utils/tick_and_dispatch\n        period 300\n        user admin\n        password admin\n      </clock-server>\n\nThis will process the message queue every five minutes.  It assumes\nthat your Plone site's ID is ``portal``, that your username and\npassword are ``admin``, and that your site is called\n``www.mysite.com``.\n\n**Note**: You must not set up this ClockServer on more than one\ninstance.  The processing makes sure it's not invoked twice at the\nsame time by using file locking.  This file locking won't work if you\nconfigure the clock server on two different servers.\n\nConfiguring zope.sendmail to send out messages\n----------------------------------------------\n\nSinging & Dancing uses `zope.sendmail`_ to send out its mail.  S&D\ncomes with a default configuration for ``zope.sendmail`` in its\n``collective/dancing/mail.zcml`` file.  This configuration will read\nSMTP parameters from your Plone site.\n\nBe warned however, that this default configuration is not suitable for\nhigh-volume newsletters.  The aforementioned configuration file\ncontains an example configuration using ``mail:queuedDelivery`` that\nworks much more reliably when dealing with a large number of mails.\n\nUpgrade\n=======\n\nIf you're upgrading your version of Singing & Dancing, it might be\nthat you need to run an upgrade of the database.  In the\n``portal_setup`` tool in the ZMI, visit the *Upgrades* tab and run any\navailable new upgrades for the ``collective.dancing:default`` profile.\n\n\nContact us\n==========\n\nIf you have a question, or comment, get in touch with us!  Feel free to\nextend S&D and send us a pull-request on github. Since all collective and\nplone packages moved to github we `prefer reporting issues on github`_ too.\n\nIf you have an older installation you may also want to have a look to our\n`mailing list`_ or `old issue tracker on launchpad`_.\n\nWe also have an IRC channel called ``#singing-dancing`` on Freenode_.\n\n\nDonate\n======\n\nDeveloping software as Open Source can be a thankless task sometimes.\nIf you're a happy user of Singing & Dancing, and you'd like to show your\nappreciation, you might want to `donate via PayPal`_.\n\nThere's other ways to contribute to the project if you're not a\ndeveloper; one is to post a message to the `mailing list`_ describing\nany successes or problems that you have with the software.  That's the\nonly way we can know if S&D is working correctly for you.\n\nAnother is to add a line to the `sites using S&D`_. Please fork S&D and update\n``SITES_USING_SINGING_AND_DANCING.rst`` in docs directory. After finishing you\ncan send us a pull request, and we'll merge it.\n\n\nDevelopers\n==========\n\nSinging & Dancing is built from scratch to be extensible.  All\ncomponents described in the `interfaces.py`_ file in\n``collective.singing`` are pluggable.\n\nDeveloper documentation exists in the form of doctests and Zope 3\ninterfaces in the source tree.  To check out the development buildout,\ntype this into your terminal::\n\n  git clone https://github.com/collective/collective.dancing singing-dancing-dev\n\nWhen the checkout is complete, you can find the doctests in ``*.txt``\nfiles in the ``src/collective.singing/collective/singing/`` and\n``collective/dancing/`` directories.  There's also a documentation area for\nuse cases and manuals in ``docs/``.\n\nGet in touch with us if you need help or have comments.

This makes it easier for users to check if substitution\n  works and variables are placed correctly when previewing newsletters.\n\n- Fix variable replacement in the \"subscriptions removed successfully\" message for\n  German translation [fRiSi]\n\n\n1.1 (2017-03-03)\n----------------\n\n- Include metadata when exporting subscriptions for a channel:\n\n  * creation_date: The creation date of this subscription\n\n  * pending:\n\n    allows to identify subscriptions that have not been validated (pending=True)\n    (otherwhise ex- and importing would add users that did not confirm their subscription)\n\n    True\n      subscription has not been validated (will not receive newsletters)\n\n    False\n      subscription has been validate\n\n    imported\n      subscription has been imported or added by an admin\n\n  * cue:\n\n    The date this subscription has received the last newsletter\n\n  * secret:\n\n    Used to authenticate when (un-)subscribing and editing personal preferences\n\n    * portal_newsletters/channels/my-channel/unsubscribe.html?secret=8a27d9c4fc2f8f0f031d654dc3172844\n\n    * portal_newsletters/my-subscriptions.html?secret=8a27d9c4fc2f8f0f031d654dc3172844\n\n    Future versions might support to import the secret so unsubscribe links work after re-importing a subscription.\n\n- Do not show subscription form on channel/subscribe.html if\n  `channel.subscribeable == False` [fRiSi]\n\n\n1.0.2 (2015-11-03)\n------------------\n\n- Fix readme file.\n  [ivanteoh]\n\n1.0.1 (2015-11-03)\n------------------\n\n- Fix html generation in `preview.pt`. Now it generates only 1 <body> tag.\n  This was a problem with plone.protect's transform.\n  [cekk]\n\n- Allow to confirm a subscription for multiple channels (fixes #8)\n  [fRiSi]\n\n- Disable diazo for `@@preview-newsletter.html`\n  [fRiSi]\n\n- Disable CSRF protection on `tick_and_dispatch` request (fixes #24)\n  [ivanteoh]\n\n\n1.0 (2015-05-11)\n----------------\n\n- Don't try to patch ATTopic if ``plone.app.collection`` is available.\n  [saily]\n\n- Made all tests pass.\n  [saily]\n\n- Add some helper functions to composer which allows ``plone.z3cform``\n  to render wysiwyg-widget with TinyMCE on channel edit form which\n  passes a composer as context.\n  [saily]\n\n- Update buildout(s) and add travis tests for plone 4.0, 4.1, ... 4.3.\n  [saily]\n\n- Align package structure to new plone conventions.\n  [saily]\n\n- Fix call of ``getSiteManager`` because imports changed from\n  ``import zope.component`` to ``from zope import component``.\n\n- plone4.3 compat [kiorky]\n\n- \"single subscribe form\" now clears secret after\n  unsubscribing from all channels. The email address\n  is preserved and the user is able to re-subscribe or\n  subscribe with another address.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Add \"Clear pending jobs\" button on\n  statistics page.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Updated danish translations.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Add better status message when unsubscribing from all channels\n  on \"single subscribe form\".\n  [tmog]\n\n- Key-fields, such as \"E-mail address\" is now disabled on \"single\n  form subscription page\" when viewing an existing subscription.\n  This was misleading anyway, since they could not really be changed.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Fix #924124: When using \"single form subscription page\"\n  User email no longer leaks into the default text of \"E-mail address\"\n  in subscribe.html for all sessions after user manages subscription.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Fix test breakage with newer versions of zope.testbrowser\n  Tested on zope.testbrowser 3.10-3.11.1\n  zope.testbrowser-3.11.1 will be pinned in the test buildout\n  for now.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Fix newsletter queue handling. Now the key to get a newsletter is the UID and not the path.\n  In this way, newsletters can be renamed/moved also when they are already in the queue, and\n  if they will be erased, the dispatch doesn't breaks.\n  [cekk]\n\n- Added two new events, raised when an user confirm or remove his subscription.\n  [cekk]\n\n- Fix Italian translations [cekk]\n\n- Added content rules to allow automated sending of content as a newsletter.\n  [djay]\n\n- Configure content rule to send as newsletter or send as link and summary only.\n  [djay]\n\n- \"Send as Newsletter\" can now be sent to an optionally subscribed section rather\n  than the whole channel.\n  [arterrey]\n\n- Import / export CSV file includes section values, and backward compatible with original format.\n  [ivanteoh]\n\n- External subscriber database and sign up form support.\n  [ivanteoh]\n\n0.9.10 (2012-02-25)\n-------------------\n\n- Fix #363127: persistent utilities will no longer destroy site after\n  an uninstall of S&D.\n  [nouri]\n\n- remove deprecation warning on plone4.1\n  [toutpt]\n\n0.9.9 (2011-07-22)\n------------------\n\n- Work around incompatibility with plone.app.z3cform's base template, by\n  changing the request in our own `switch_on` function and removing the more\n  specialized `IPloneFormLayer`, thus falling back on the layer from\n  `plone.z3cform` and its base template.\n  Closes https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/697348.\n  [hannosch]\n\n0.9.8 (2011-07-21)\n------------------\n\n- Replace several untranslatable strings.\n  [pfurman]\n\n- Fixed compatibility with Plone 4.1 by (conditionally) loading the\n  permissions.zcml from CMFCore.  (Still works on Plone 3.3 and 4.0\n  too.)\n  [maurits]\n\n- Link to new manual.\n  [nouri]\n\n0.9.7 (2011-02-23)\n------------------\n\n- Support acquisition-wrapped channel; the possible wrapping of the\n  channel object is particularly important with subscriptions since\n  the ``five.intid`` utility is used to track them and has delicate\n  code to avoid acquisition \"loops\".\n  [malthe]\n\n- Fixed issue that allowed an anonymous user to confirm a random\n  subscriber from a channel for which the standard confirm view is\n  exposed.\n  [malthe]\n\n0.9.6 (2011-02-10)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed critical issue that allowed an anonymous user to unsubscribe a\n  random subscriber from a channel for which the standard unsubscribe\n  view is exposed.\n  [malthe]\n\n- Fixed unclosed input tag for including the hidden secret.\n  [maurits]\n\n0.9.5 (2010-12-26)\n------------------\n\n- Updated the patched `queryCatalog` method of the collection class with\n  changes from the baseline.\n  [hannosch]\n\n0.9.4 (2010-12-03)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed release.\n\n0.9.3 (2010-12-03)\n------------------\n\n- Added configuration setting for ``keep_sent_messages`` (new in\n  ``collective.singing`` 0.7.1).\n  [malthe]\n\n- Fixed CSV Download view for not to break on composers that include list,\n  boolean and datetime fields.\n  [piv]\n\n- Documentation updates.  [saily]\n\n- Added italian translation, thanks to Augusto Sosa.  [saily]\n\n- Update French translation to reflect change of channel to mailing list\n  [toutpt]\n\n0.9.2 (2010-11-04)\n------------------\n\n- Documentation updates.   [saily]\n\n- Fixed the stub mailer (encoding issue). [malthe]\n\n0.9.1 (2010-11-04)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed the stub mailer (how it ever could work is unclear). [malthe]\n\n- Update test to pass on Plone4\n  [toutpt] [pbauer]\n\n- Refactoring send/preview form because formtabbing did not work.\n  [saily]\n\n- Reverted changeset 119773 since users could not send folderish content\n  types any more (RichDocument is a folderish content type).\n  [saily]\n\n0.9.0 (2010-08-01)\n------------------\n\n- The send form is now split into two subforms, one for send, and one for\n  preview. **NOTE!** This introduces incompatible changes if you are having\n  custom forms (although the changes necessary are simple).\n  [regebro]\n\n- The \"Send as newsletter\" action is now no longer shown on folders by\n  default.\n  [regebro]\n\n- A new 'mass delete from csv' feature has been added to the channel\n  administration page. [kiorky]\n\n- French translations have been updatedĂÂ [kiorky]\n\n- \"Channels\" have been renamed \"Mailing-lists\" in the userinterface. [regebro]\n\n- Norwegian translation. [regebro]\n\n0.8.17 (2010-06-11)\n-------------------\n\n- Fix for subscription portlet breaking batch workflow state change.\n  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/475771\n  [maurits]\n\n- When no address has been selected for sending the preview to, inform\n  the user instead of sending the preview to *all* subscribers.\n  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/509577\n  [maurits]\n\n- When compactifying the sent html with stoneagehtml catch an error that\n  can occur with some css code, that stoneagehtml tries to clean up\n  using cssutils.\n  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/410238\n  [maurits]\n\n- Changed all occurences of site-title to site_title (in help strings\n  and translations).\n  Fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/296759\n  [maurits]\n\n- We now avoid including all zcml from five.intid (in the same way as e.g.\n  plone.app.intid) This means we avoid registering the IPersistent handlers,\n  which (among other issues) can cause problems for packages that put persistent\n  items in temporary storage. Instead we explicitly register handlers for\n  ISubscription. The issue is discussed here:\n  http://www.mail-archive.com/zodb-dev@zope.org/msg04398.html\n  And at length, as pertaining to the getpaid package, here:\n  http://code.google.com/p/getpaid/issues/detail?id=209.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Reverted changeset 113529 since it broke subscriber searching (and tests).\n  The revert has likely reintroduced a problem with deleting subscriptions,\n  but I've been unable to reproduce this.\n  [tmog]\n\n- When importing email addresses, convert all addresses to lowercase\n  instead of rejecting them.\n  [maurits]\n\n- Update french translation\n  [toutpt]\n\nVersion 0.8.16 - 2010-04-07\n---------------------------\n\n- Fixed translations that were causing compile errors on Zope startup,\n  resulting in old translations showing up for a language (taken from\n  the outdated .mo file), or no translations at all.\n  [maurits]\n\n- Updated Dutch translations.\n  [maurits]\n\n- Fixed a bug that made it impossible to delete some subscriptions.\n  [regebro]\n\nVersion 0.8.15 - 2010-02-01\n---------------------------\n\n- Added a development buildout and automated test runner setup to the package.\n  [hannosch]\n\n- Fixed ConfigurationError: ('Missing parameter:', 'description') on Plone 3\n  with the last upgrade steps.\n  [toutpt]\n\nVersion 0.8.14 - 2010-01-28\n---------------------------\n\n- Added missing upgrade steps for all recent versions. This makes the package\n  comply with the upgrade logic of the Plone add-ons control panel.\n  [hannosch]\n\n- Follow best practice and decouple the profile metadata from the software\n  version in setup.py.\n  [hannosch]\n\n- Added a z3c.autoinclude entry point to mark this as a Plone add-on.\n  [hannosch]\n\n- Added our own overrides.zcml to load the one from plone.z3cform. You cannot\n  load overrides in the configure stage.\n  [hannosch]\n\n- Add log on ATTopic Patch.\n  [toutpt]\n\n- Update French translations.\n  [toutpt]\n\n- Fix i18n pot file by escape quotes.\n  [toutpt]\n\n- Extended the HTML composer so that you can select which composer template\n  to use. You register new composer templates by instantiating a template\n  somewhere in your code::\n\n    >>> mytemplate = ViewPageTemplateFile('browser/composer-html.pt')\n\n  and registering that in ZCML::\n\n    <utility component=\".module.mytemplate\"\n           name=\"My Custom Template\"\n           provides=\"collective.dancing.interfaces.IHTMLComposerTemplate\" />\n\n  [regebro]\n\nVersion 0.8.13 - 2009-10-19\n---------------------------\n\n- The attribute 'subscribeable' now defaults to False on newly created\n  channels. This means newly created channels will not show up on my-subscriptions\n  before they are made subscribeable from the channels configuration page.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Disabled stoneagehtml style attributes blacklist since it stripped\n  out font-familiy from the styles added to a channel which confused\n  several users. This fixes http://tinyurl.com/ygmhv7a\n  Unfortunately its not possible to specify a custom\n  black list like stoneagehtml.compactify(html, filter_tags=['position'...])\n  since the stoneagehtml dosen't support that yet - http://tinyurl.com/ykwca4p.\n  [pelle]\n\n- Fixed bug that caused the \"Include collector items\" option to\n  be ignored (i.e. always on) in \"Send as newsletter\" previews.\n  Also, there is now a default cue for the dummy preview subscriber.\n  The cue is always \"one week ago\".\n  [tmog]\n\nVersion 0.8.12 - 2009-09-15\n---------------------------\n\n- Changed the email address validation. The old one allowed a few bad\n  addresses to slip through - addresses with trailing dots for instance.\n  The new validation is generally stricter. Note that 'simple' local addresses\n  like 'admin@localhost' are no longer allowed. For special use-cases where you\n  need this, you must change the validation RegExp. However, for most usecases, I\n  believe this is a big improvement.\n  [tmog]\n\nVersion 0.8.11 - 2009-09-03\n---------------------------\n\n- Added alternative \"My subscriptions\" page. It's based on a single form\n  with subforms, instead of multiple forms like the old one. It's main\n  feature is that it displays the ISubscriptionKey (the email address ;-))\n  and \"subscribe\" button only once. It has a checkbox for subscribing to\n  each channel.\n  To try the new version, select it from the new \"Global settings\" controlpanel.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Translated new messageids for german language and updated some old ones.\n  [saily]\n\nVersion 0.8.10 - 2009-06-11\n---------------------------\n\n- Fix bug where collector sort criteria other than 'created' and\n  'effective' would result in an error. [nouri]\n\n- Fixed and added test for newsletter preview form.  The preview in\n  the channel page would fail before with ``TypeError: eval() arg 1\n  must be a string or code object``. [nouri]\n\nVersion 0.8.9 - 2009-03-11\n--------------------------\n\n- Fix the bug that Doug found where items from collectors would be\n  rendered fully. [nouri]\n\n- Update installation instructions to account for Plone 3.2.x\n  buildouts, which are somewhat different. [nouri]\n\n- Added optional keyword argument ``override_vars`` to\n  Composer.render.  ``override_vars`` are now a override individual\n  ``composer_vars`` from e.g. the ``send-newsletter.html`` form.\n\n  I've included an example of this in the section \"Customizing the\n  send as newsletter form\" in browser.txt (and the new\n  ``send-newsletter-custom-subject.html`` view).  This is a pretty\n  pervasive change since it needs to work with asynchronous sending,\n  email-previewing, browser-previewing, and with scheduled delivery.\n\n  Included is an upgrade step for migrating ``TimedScheduler.items``\n  to the new format.  Refer to the Upgrade_ section for details on how\n  to run upgrades.  [tmog]\n\nVersion 0.8.8 - 2009-02-01\n--------------------------\n\n- Fix a dependency issue with collective.singing. [nouri]\n\nVersion 0.8.7 - 2009-02-01\n--------------------------\n\n- We now have much easier installation instructions. [nouri]\n\n- Fix #313044: Don't mess up ``javascript:`` links when making\n  absolute links out of relative ones. [nouri]\n\nVersion 0.8.6 - 2009-01-20\n--------------------------\n\n- Fix #318725: Don't mess up ``mailto:`` links when making absolute\n  links out of relative ones.  Thanks to Scribbles. [nouri]\n\n- Exclude all markup with class ``newsletterExclude`` when sending out\n  mail.  This allows for a lo-fi way of marking parts of your template\n  for exclusion if you can't be bothered to write your own\n  ``IFormatItem``. [nouri]\n\n- Added sort_criteria dict to the collector module. It allows to specify\n  different query based on the current cue for different sort criteria.\n  [naro]\n\nVersion 0.8.5 - 2009-01-05\n--------------------------\n\n- Extended the CVS input of subscribers to allow arbitrary CVS fields\n  to be stored as part of the subscriptions, and then included in the\n  composer output using the ``${composervariableFIELDNAME1}``\n  syntax. [russf]\n\nVersion 0.8.4 - 2009-01-02\n--------------------------\n\n- Added some sensible defaults to\n  ``collective.dancing.composer.plone_html_strip`` so that key html is\n  filtered out. [pigeonflight]\n\n- Add experimental support for zexp. [nouri]\n\n- Added upgradestep to migrate existing MessageQueues to\n  collective.singing.queue.CompositeQueue.\n  This fixes slow iteration over large queues and\n  extremely slow rendering of the staticstics page.\n  [tmog]\n\nVersion 0.8.3 - 2008-12-03\n--------------------------\n\n- Fix issue with unicodeerrors on statistics page because of bad Job-messages.\n  Described in https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/299950\n  [tmog]\n\n- Part of Czech translation.\n  [naro]\n\n- Improved block structure and added classes and ids. Replaced paras with divs.\n  These changes will impact existing CSS.  [russf]\n\n- Use of ``Template().substitute`` will be fatal on any un-escaped where $ will\n  occur - like on all recent news items :( safe_substitute behaves properly in\n  these cirumstances.  [russf]\n\n- Some refactoring in order to allow for more customized subscription forms.\n  [nouri]\n\n- Added french translation.\n\n- Made new job-view ``browser/jobs.pt`` translateable, rebuilt pot file and\n  updated german translation.  [saily]\n\nVersion 0.8.2 - 2008-11-17\n--------------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug in ``HTMLComposer`` where unsubscribe_url could not be substituted\n  by template engine because of double dollars in variable name.  [saily]\n\nVersion 0.8.1 - 2008-11-14\n--------------------------\n\n- Small refactoring of tests to allow for reuse of test infrastructure\n  in third party tests. [nouri]\n\nVersion 0.8.0 - 2008-11-12\n--------------------------\n\n- Added bouncing support: The new utility view\n  ``@@dancing.utils/handle_bounce`` takes a list of addresses and\n  marks subscriptions as pending when it receives more than two bounce\n  notifications.  This has the effect that no more messages are sent\n  to that subscription, while the subscription is still present in the\n  database. [nouri]\n\n- Added caching to composer rendering.  Caching is done based on\n  ``_vars`` and collected items.  Notice that ``composer._vars`` has\n  been split into two; ``_vars`` and ``_subscription_vars``. The\n  latter containing variables that are likely to be unique to the\n  subscription, and the former those that are likely shared across\n  multiple subscriptions.\n\n  Rendering is now broken into two step:\n\n  1) Rendering the ``composer-html`` template and compacting the\n     resulting html with StoneAgeHTML.  ``_vars`` and collected items\n     is available in the template.  This step is cached on ``_vars``\n     and items.\n\n  2) ``string.Template`` variable replacement on the html of variables\n     in ``_subscription_vars``.  In the default implementation only\n     the subscribers secret in the subscription management urls is\n     replaced.\n\n  [tmog]\n\nVersion 0.7.7 - 2008-11-05\n--------------------------\n\n- Set ``ignoreContext = True`` for SubscriptionsSearchForm.  Before\n  I'd get ``AttributeError: 'ManageSubscriptionsForm' object has no\n  attribute 'fulltext'``, but strangely enough not in the tests and\n  only in one installation that I know of.  [nouri]\n\nVersion 0.7.6 - 2008-11-05\n--------------------------\n\n- German translation has been updated.\n  [saily]\n\n- Used i18ndude to find all untranslated msgid's. There were some updates in\n  collective.dancing queue-button-naming, so all guy's please help updating\n  collective.dancing's po files.  [saily]\n\n- Fixed a bug where when sending a preview we were incorrectly setting\n  the ``cue`` of the subscription that the preview is sent to. [nouri]\n\n- Fix #264990: When sending out a newsletter from a content item\n  manually, we no longer assemble all message in the course of the\n  browser request.  Instead, we schedule a job that's executed\n  asynchronously on ``tick_and_dispatch`` time. [nouri]\n\nVersion 0.7.5 - 2008-10-27\n--------------------------\n\n- Move file locking from queue dispatch to the ``tick_and_dispatch``\n  browser view.  This is to make sure that we don't put duplicates\n  into the queue.  This is because the underlying queue implementation\n  will actually work against us here by allowing simultaneous adds in\n  parallel ZODB- writes. [nouri]\n\n- Fix #289779: Strip whitespace from e-mail addresses. [nouri]\n\n- Added ``encoding`` attribute on the ``HTMLComposer`` class to make\n  it possible to either subclass and provide a different default\n  encoding, or set a persistent attribute. [malthe]\n\n- Fix #280338: Images in header and footer text were sent with\n  relative URLs. [nouri]\n\n- It's now possible to filter channels from the sendnewsletter view.\n  Simple by setting channel.sendable=False.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Fixed an issue with installing collective.dancing from python.\n  The event-listener registering ISalt on creation of a new tool\n  no longer depends upon having a request. [tmog]\n\n- zope.conf configuration with Virtual Host added in\n  documentation [macadames]\n\nVersion 0.7.4 - 2008-09-19\n--------------------------\n\n- Fix an issue where confirming pending subscriptions by visiting the \"My\n  subscriptions\" page.  If a subscription is already confirmed the dictionary\n  ``subscription.metadata`` does not have a key ``pending``.  [saily]\n\nVersion 0.7.3 - 2008-09-16\n--------------------------\n\n- Rebuild ``collective.dancing.pot`` and updated German\n  translation. [saily]\n\n- Removed bug in ``ManageSubscriptionsForm.remove``. When the search box\n  was added we also changed the ``ManageSubscriptionsForm.get_items`` method\n  to return the secret instead of the name. The remove method was not updated,\n  and delete of subscriptions did not work. [saily]\n\n- Removed bug in CSV-export. Export must have same ordered fields or\n  columns as expected on import. As we are using the composer schema\n  for import, we should use this for export too. [saily]\n\n- Make CSV export and import use the same delimiter.\n  [saily]\n\nVersion 0.7.2 - 2008-09-15\n--------------------------\n\n- Fix an issue where the scheduled send-out would send out items in\n  their short form, i.e. only title and description.  [miziodel, nouri]\n\n- Add a search box to the subscriptions administration view.\n\n  Prior versions of S&D didn't populate the subscribers fulltext index\n  correctly.  This version adds an upgrade step that you'll need to\n  run in order to reindex all your subscription objects.\n\n  Refer to the Upgrade_ section for details on how to run upgrades.\n  [nouri]\n\n- Allow pending subscriptions to be conformed by visiting the \"My\n  subscriptions\" page.  This allows users to confirm their\n  subscriptions even if they've lost or never received their message\n  for confirm.  [nouri]\n\n- More fine-tuning of the ``PloneCallHTMLFormatter``: Strip unwanted\n  content like the review history in a configurable way.  [nouri]\n\nVersion 0.7.1 - 2008-09-05\n--------------------------\n\n- Added workaround for a bug in the composer where ``header_text`` or\n  ``footer_text`` are ``None``.  No idea why they're ``None``, though.\n\nVersion 0.7.0 - 2008-09-05\n--------------------------\n\n- Added a new field ``subject`` for the composer.  This allows more\n  control over what subject outgoing messages have, using string\n  templates.  The default is ``${site_title}: ${channel_title}``.\n\n  Removed the ``<h1>`` from the default composer template.  You can\n  now use the ``header text`` of the composer to the same effect.  The\n  default header text has now become ``<h1>${subject}</h1>`` to mimic\n  the old behaviour.\n\n  On the API side of things, I changed the signature of\n  ``dancing.composer.HTMLComposer._vars``.  Since overriding this is\n  the recommended way of providing your own variables, this warrants a\n  0.7.0 release.  I'm thinking about adding a little variable provider\n  component as an alternative to subclassing.\n  [nouri]\n\n- Added missing header with containing style and title tag in\n  ``composer-html-forgot.pt`` and ``composer-html-confirm.pt``.\n  [saily]\n\nVersion 0.6.5 - 2008-09-04\n--------------------------\n\n- Add header and footer fields for the composer and its form.  This\n  allows us to add text at the beginning and at the end of messages in\n  an easy and consistent way. [nouri]\n\n- Fix #264694: Using non ASCII characters in context title\n  of send-newsletter raises ``UnicodeEncodeError``. [saily]\n\n- Make ``PloneCallHTMLFormatter`` even more robust by switching to\n  using ``BeautifulSoup`` instead of ``str.find`` to parse the\n  contents. [nouri]\n\nVersion 0.6.4 - 2008-09-03\n--------------------------\n\n- Added a default ITransform adapter for S&D called\n  ``dancing.transform.URL``.  This will rewrite relative links and the\n  like automatically.  Relative links were the cause of broken links\n  and images in the outgoing messages.  This fixes #262633.\n\n  What this transform also allows is the definition of one or more\n  backend URLs that it should replace by a canonical URL.  See\n  ``transform.txt`` for details. [tmog, nouri]\n\n- Fix #262612: The Reply-To field is not included as message header.\n\nVersion 0.6.3 - 2008-09-01\n--------------------------\n\n- Have the S&D SMTPMailer subclass from zope.sendmail's.  This allows\n  the use of TLS with the standard configuration and fixes #263271.\n\nVersion 0.6.2 - 2008-08-28\n--------------------------\n\n- Updated docs with information on how to configure\n  ``mail:queuedDelivery`` of ``zope.sendmail``. [nouri]\n\n- Make the ``PloneCallHTMLFormatter`` which is the fallback formatter\n  for all objects more robust. [tmog]\n\n- Improve internationalization with newsletter object titles. [tmog]\n\n- Fixed a bug in csv-export if you use more composer_data than just\n  email address. [saily]\n\n- Some people have reported that S&D is sending out duplicate mails on\n  high-traffic newsletters.  I've added a ``StubSMTPMailer`` utility,\n  which you can register conveniently in\n  ``collective/dancing/mail.zcml``.  No mail will be sent out when\n  it's configured instead of the default one.  This allows you to\n  debug and fine-tune settings, e.g. those of your configured\n  ``mail:queuedDelivery`` component. [nouri]\n\n- Changed batch_size in browser/channel.py to 30 to stay at Plone's\n  default. [saily]\n\n- German translation updated. [saily]\n\n- Rebuild of collective.dancing.pot using i18ndude. Some translation\n  updates needed. [saily]\n\nVersion 0.6.1 - 2008-08-22\n--------------------------\n\n- On reinstall, advise QuickInstaller not to delete the five.intid\n  tool that we set up during installation.  This fixes the brokenness\n  of the subscription catalogs after a reinstall.  A typical error\n  you'd see would look like::\n\n    ...\n     Module collective.singing.subscribe, line 227, in subscription_modified\n     Module collective.singing.subscribe, line 214, in _catalog_subscription\n     Module five.intid.intid, line 36, in getId\n     Module zope.app.intid, line 86, in getId\n    KeyError: SimpleSubscription ...\n\n  No migration is available at this point.  Contact us if you need\n  help writing one.  Note that the use of QuickInstaller\n  reinstallation isn't required with Singing & Dancing.  For how to\n  run upgrades from one version to the next, please see the Upgrade_\n  section.  A QuickInstaller reinstallation will not run these\n  upgrades for you.  [nouri]\n\nVersion 0.6.0 - 2008-08-21\n--------------------------\n\n- Update to use Singing's new IMessageAssemble API. [nouri]\n\n- Use batching for the subscriptions management view.  Also, reshuffle\n  the order of tabs in the channel administration view.  Most notably:\n  move the \"Subscriptions\" tab to the first position to allow more\n  comfortable editing. [nouri]\n\nVersion 0.5.1 - 2008-08-15\n--------------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug where a collector would have a ``Title`` property; this\n  should be a method. [malthe]\n\n- Added permissions to send, preview and manage newsletter. No upgrade\n  steps required - just reinstall. By default - send and preview is\n  allowed to reviewer and manager role, manage newsletters for\n  managers only. [saily]\n\nVersion 0.5.0 - 2008-07-29\n--------------------------\n\n- Display a more user friendly error message when the user attempts to\n  add duplicate subscriptions.\n  [miziodel, nouri]\n\n- List of subscribers can now be uploaded and downloaded in CSV format!\n  [skatja]\n\n- Depend on 0.3 or higher of plone.app.z3cform.\n  [nouri]\n\nVersion 0.4.1 - 2008-07-23\n--------------------------\n\n- Fix ``RuntimeError: maximum recursion depth exceeded`` error in\n  ``Module collective.dancing.browser.portlets.channelsubscribe, line\n  253, in channel`` when displaying portlets that were created prior\n  to 0.4b4.\n  [nouri]\n\nVersion 0.4 - 2008-07-23\n------------------------\n\nNew features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Added subject, confirmation_subject and forgot_secret_subject to\n  vars of composer for easy customization.  Defaults are unchanged.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Added sender name, sender address and reply-to address as per\n  composer configuration. Composer configuration is now available\n  in the new Composers fieldset of the channel edit view.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Allow for easier subclassing of HTMLComposer.  The ``_vars()``\n  method is now more generally applicable and easily to override.\n  [nouri]\n\n- Made adding thirdparty Channels possible. This works the same as\n  with Collectors - you simply implement you custom channel and add\n  a factory to the collective.dancing.channel.channels list.\n  Preview and edit forms are now class methods on ManageChannelView\n  to make it easier to subclass for your custom channels.\n  [tmog]\n\n- Pass on raw item as received from the collector to the composer\n  (template).  Making use of this raw item will obviously bind the\n  implementation of the composer to that of the collector.  However,\n  it's considered useful for custom implementations that need total\n  control and that know what collector they'll be using.\n\n  This required an API change in IComposer.render(); the ``items``\n  argument is now a list of 2-tuples instead of a list of formatted\n  items.\n  [nouri]\n\n- Added Polish translation by Barbara Struk\n  [naro]\n\n- Added another type of scheduler: TimedScheduler.  This one allows to\n  schedule a number of send-outs with an exact datetime.  Its main use\n  is for the \"send newsletter\" form on a context where we want to\n  specify a send-out date in the future.\n  [nouri]\n\n- The confirmation view will now confirm pending subscriptions to any\n  channel.  This saves us from having to send a separate confirmation\n  e-mail for every channel a user subscribes to.  This feature isn't\n  used anywhere in S&D core at this point, but it's useful if you're\n  writing custom subscription forms.\n  [nouri]\n\n- Added SubjectsCollectorBase template class that you can use to\n  create a collector based on a vocabulary.  This vocabulary may come\n  from anywhere, like from ATVocabularyManager or from the list of all\n  subjects/tags available in your site.\n  [nouri]\n\n- Text fields will now per default not be included in the resulting\n  message if there are no sibling collectors that produced items.\n  E.g. if you have a heading text and a sibling topic collector, the\n  heading won't appear if the topic didn't return any items.\n  [nouri]\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- Updated installation instructions to use the ``fake-zope-eggs``\n  feature of the ``plone.recipe.zope2install`` instead of\n  ``fakezope2eggs``.  Also, added ``skip-fake-eggs`` to accommodate\n  latest changes in ``plone.z3cform``.\n\n- Use ``CompositeQueue`` instead of the simple zc.queue.Queue for\n  queueing and archiving mails.  This should help with memory bloat\n  when there's a lot of messages in the queue.\n  [nouri]\n\n- Don't attempt to do any workflow transition with ATTopic items\n  created in the collector; the default workflow will do fine, and we\n  avoid errors when using workflows other than the default one.\n  [nouri]\n\n- Don't bail if no items are available for preview.\n  [malthe]\n\nVersion 0.3 - 2008-06-03\n------------------------\n\nNew features\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Add translations to German.\n  [saily]\n\n- Added preview also to channel view.  This was previously only\n  available for the \"send as newsletter\" action.\n  [malthe]\n\n- Refactored channels management view and the dedicated channel view.\n  Big improvements to usability of the channel view.\n  [malthe]\n\n- Added capability to embed stylesheets in outgoing mail.  Right now,\n  this is a simple text field that can be set on the channel's composer.\n  We're now making use of the StoneAgeHTML library to embed styles in\n  the individual HTML elements instead of providing styles in the\n  ``<head>`` of the HTML document.  This gives us much better support\n  with quirky e-mail clients out there.\n  [malthe]\n\n  In the future, we want to extend this to allow administrators to\n  select themes for individual channels by browsing and selecting from a\n  list of registered styles.\n\n- Added Czech translation.\n  [naro]\n\n- Refactored ``mail.py`` to create ``MIMEMultipart`` based messages.\n  This allows us to easily adapt the mail sending process to embed\n  images and the like.\n  [naro]\n\n- Added a \"reference collector\".  This allows you to select individual\n  portal items to be sent out, as opposed to items collected by a Smart\n  Folder or the like.\n  [malthe]\n\nBugfixes\n~~~~~~~~\n\n- S&D 0.3b2 introduced an incompatible change with channels created in\n  0.3b1 and earlier.  I added a GenericSetup upgrade step to fix this.\n  The relevant code is in the ``collective.dancing.upgrade`` module.\n\n  If you're using a legacy database with channels that were created\n  before version 0.3b2, you'll need to run this upgrade step, or\n  you'll see this error::\n\n    TypeError: ('object.__new__(HTMLComposer) is not safe, use persistent.Persistent.__new__()', <function _reconstructor at ...>, (<class 'collective.dancing.composer.HTMLComposer'>, <type 'object'>, None))\n\n  Refer to the Upgrade_ section for details on how to run upgrades.\n  [nouri]\n\n- Add ``metadata.xml`` to make QuickInstaller happy with version\n  numbers.\n  [naro]\n\n- Back to using checkboxes for multi selection instead of ``select``.\n  [nouri]\n\n- Make HTMLComposer and channel.composers persistent so that changes\n  to template and composers are conveniently persisted.\n  [nouri]\n\n- Use ``zc.lockfile`` to lock the queue processing (sending out of mail)\n  instead of excessively using ``transaction.commit()``, which caused\n  massive ZODB bloat when a lot of messages were involved.\n  [nouri]\n\n- Use ``email.Header`` for message header formatting.  This allows for\n  better internationalization in headers of outgoing e-mails.\n  [naro]\n\n- In-browser preview now displays what would really be sent out,\n  i.e. after collectors and transforms could do their thing.  Before, it\n  used to only display the context item as mail.\n  [malthe]\n\nVersion 0.2 - 2008-05-06\n------------------------\n\n- Add an 'Already subscribed?\" section to the \"My subscriptions\"\n  page to retrieve your password.\n  [nouri]\n\n- added i18n:domain to browser/controlpanel-links.pt, removed extra quotes\n  from browser/channel.py, updated pot and danish translation\n  [bartholdy]\n\n- updated .pot and danish translation\n  [bartholdy]\n\n- apparently triplequoted strings do not get translated ..\n  this takes care of\n  https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/218448\n  [bartholdy]\n\n- Don't use locale-dependent 'string.letters' when creating the\n  ISalt utility.  This fixes\n  https://bugs.launchpad.net/singing-dancing/+bug/217823\n  [nouri]\n\n- Extended portlet with optinal footertext\n  [bartholdy]\n\n- Added functionality to show a preview in the browser\n
