{"info":{"author":"Chris Reinke","author_email":"chris.reinke@inria.fr","bugtrack_url":null,"classifiers":[],"description":"Current version: 0.3.6 (09/11/2023)\n\n# Introduction\n\nExperiment Utilities (exputils) contains various tools for the management of scientific experiments and their experimental data.\nIt is especially designed to handle experimental repetitions, including to run different repetitions, to effectively store and load data for them, and to visualize their results.  \n \nMain features:\n* Easy definition of default configurations using nested python dictionaries.\n* Setup of experimental configuration parameters using an ODF file.\n* Running of experiments and their repetitions in parallel.\n* Logging of experimental data (numpy, json).\n* Loading and filtering of experimental data.\n* Interactive Jupyter widgets to load, select and plot data as line, box and bar plots.  \n\n# <a name=\"requirements\"></a>Requirements\n\nDeveloped and tested for Python 3.6 to 3.9 on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04).\n\nDepends on the following python packages which will be automatically installed during the setup:\n* numpy >= 1.19.5\n* six >= 1.15.0\n* notebook <= 6.5.6  # exputils notebook widgets do not support new notebook version of 7\n* ipywidgets >= 7.5.1,<= 7.6.5  # needs older version due to https://github.com/quantopian/qgrid/issues/372\n* jupyter_contrib_nbextensions >= 0.7.0\n* qgrid >= 1.3.1\n* plotly >= 4.13.0\n* cloudpickle >= 1.6.0\n* dill >= 0.3.3\n* odfpy >= 1.4.1\n* tabulate >= 0.8.9\n* scipy >= 1.5.4\n* tensorboard >= 1.15.0\n* fasteners >= 0.18\n* pyyaml >= 6.0\n\n\n# <a name=\"setup\"></a>Setup\n\n__1) Exputils__\n\n*Via PIP*\n\n    pip install experiment-utilities\n\n*From Source*\n\nClone the repository via git and install via pip:\n    \n    git clone git@gitlab.inria.fr:creinke/exputils.git .\n    pip install ./exputils\n\n(To install the library as a developer so that changes to its source code are directly usable in other projects:\n`pip install -e ./exputils`)\n\n\n__2) Jupiter Notebook__\n\nFor using the exputils GUIs for loading and plotting of data in Jupyter Notebook, the *qgrid* widget must be activated.\n(Note: The GUI is currently only tested for Jupyter notebooks. For Jupyterlab, other installation procedures are necessary.)\nActivate *qgrid* with:\n\n    jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n    jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix widgetsnbextension\n    jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix qgrid\n\nIt is recommended to use the [Jupyter Notebooks Extensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions) to allow folding of code and headlines.\nThis makes the notebooks more readable.\nActivate the extensions with:\n\n    jupyter nbextension enable codefolding/main\n    jupyter nbextension enable collapsible_headings/main\n\n\n# <a name=\"overview\"></a>Overview\n\nBesides the exputils library (the python package) the project also contains example code and unit tests. \nIt is recommended to look at these items to learn about the usage of the exputils components. \n\nThe exputils package has the following structure:\n - **manage**: Managing of experiments. Generation of code for experiments and repetitions from ODS configurations and source templates. Running of experiments and repetitions (can be used to run experiments on clusters.)   \n - **data**: Logging and loading of experimental data including filtering of data. \n - **gui**: GUI components for Jupyter to load and plot experimental data.\n - **misc**: Miscellaneous helper functions.\n - **io**: Input-output functions to save and load data of various formats, including numpy and json.\n\nExperiments are stored in a specific folder structure which allows to save and load experimental data in a structured manner.\nPlease note that  it represents a default structure which can be adapted if required.\nElements in brackets (\\<custom name>\\) can have custom names.   \nFolder structure:\n * **\\<main\\>** folder: Holds several experimental campaigns. A campaign holds experiments of the same kind but with different parameters.\n    * **analyze** folder: Scripts such as Jupyter notebooks to analyze the different experimental campaigns in this main-folder.\n    * **\\<experimental campaign\\>** folders:\n        * **analyze** folder: Scripts such as Jupyter notebooks to analyze the different experiments in this experimental campaign. \n        * **experiment_configurations.ods** file: ODS file that contains the configuration parameters of the different experiments in this campaign.\n        * **src** folder: Holds code templates of the experiments.\n            * **\\<repetition code\\>** folders: Code templates that are used under the repetition folders of th experiments. These contain the acutal experimental code that should be run.\n            * **\\<experiment code\\>** folders: Code templates that are used under the experiment folder of the experiment. These contain usually code to compute statistics over all repetitions of an experiment.\n        * **generate_code.sh** file: Script file that generates the experimental code under the **experiments** folder using the configuration in the **experiment_configurations.ods** file and the code under the **src** folder.               \n        * **experiments** folder: Contains generated code for experiments and the collected experimental data.\n            * **experiment_{id}** folders:\n                * **repetition_{id}** folders:\n                    * **data** folder: Experimental data for the single repetitions, such as logs.\n                    * code files: Generated code and resource files.\n                * **data** folder: Experimental data for the whole experiment, e.g. statistics that are calculated over all repetitions.   \n                * **\\<code\\>** files: Generated code and resource files.\n        * **\\<run scripts\\>.sh** files: Various shell scripts to run experiments and calculate statistics locally or on clusters.\n\n# <a name=\"team-members\"></a>Development Team\n\n__Main__\n\n* [Chris Reinke](http:www.scirei.net):
