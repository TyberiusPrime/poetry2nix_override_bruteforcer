This\nprevents accidentally shadowing your build system, but some packages, like\nbuild tools, want to act as their own backend.\n\n``intreehooks`` is a shim to work around this, so that a source tree can be\nbuilt by itself. To use it, write a pyproject.toml like this:\n\n.. code-block:: ini\n\n    [build-system]\n    requires = [\"intreehooks\"]  # + any other packages required to build\n    build-backend = \"intreehooks:loader\"\n\n    [tool.intreehooks]\n    build-backend = \"flit.buildapi\"  # Import path of your real backend\n\n\n","description_content_type":null,"docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/takluyver/intreehooks","keywords":"","license":"","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"intreehooks","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/intreehooks/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/intreehooks/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://github.com/takluyver/intreehooks"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/intreehooks/1.0/","requires_dist":["pytoml"],"requires_python":"","summary":"Load a PEP 517 backend from inside the source tree","version":"1.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":3380503,"releases":{"1.0":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"725db6e188060e2a73b1d6eec7378ad18887c288a59a8cda1f5e2091519c91d9","md5":"5747b68ee097bd3ee43b03c182599719","sha256":"937fd547f6a8a913107eaba51875dd1e185c00c2f0e68bcb217821962db4caec"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"intreehooks-1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"5747b68ee097bd3ee43b03c182599719","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py2.py3","requires_python":null,"size":3664,"upload_time":"2017-12-01T16:16:58","upload_time_iso_8601":"2017-12-01T16:16:58.131674Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/72/5d/b6e188060e2a73b1d6eec7378ad18887c288a59a8cda1f5e2091519c91d9/intreehooks-1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"f9a55dacebf93232a847970921af2b020f9f2a8e0064e3a97727cd38efc77ba0","md5":"5b95c8cab2cfcbf3385c87216878e3cd","sha256":"87e600d3b16b97ed219c078681260639e77ef5a17c0e0dbdd5a302f99b4e34e1"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"intreehooks-1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"5b95c8cab2cfcbf3385c87216878e3cd","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":2701,"upload_time":"2017-12-01T16:16:59","upload_time_iso_8601":"2017-12-01T16:16:59.432665Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f9/a5/5dacebf93232a847970921af2b020f9f2a8e0064e3a97727cd38efc77ba0/intreehooks-1.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"725db6e188060e2a73b1d6eec7378ad18887c288a59a8cda1f5e2091519c91d9","md5":"5747b68ee097bd3ee43b03c182599719","sha256":"937fd547f6a8a913107eaba51875dd1e185c00c2f0e68bcb217821962db4caec"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"intreehooks-1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"5747b68ee097bd3ee43b03c182599719","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py2.py3","requires_python":null,"size":3664,"upload_time":"2017-12-01T16:16:58","upload_time_iso_8601":"2017-12-01T16:16:58.131674Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/72/5d/b6e188060e2a73b1d6eec7378ad18887c288a59a8cda1f5e2091519c91d9/intreehooks-1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"f9a55dacebf93232a847970921af2b020f9f2a8e0064e3a97727cd38efc77ba0","md5":"5b95c8cab2cfcbf3385c87216878e3cd","sha256":"87e600d3b16b97ed219c078681260639e77ef5a17c0e0dbdd5a302f99b4e34e1"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"intreehooks-1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"5b95c8cab2cfcbf3385c87216878e3cd","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":2701,"upload_time":"2017-12-01T16:16:59","upload_time_iso_8601":"2017-12-01T16:16:59.432665Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f9/a5/5dacebf93232a847970921af2b020f9f2a8e0064e3a97727cd38efc77ba0/intreehooks-1.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
