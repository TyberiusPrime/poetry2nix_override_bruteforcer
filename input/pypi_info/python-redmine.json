issue journals (see `docs\n  <https://python-redmine.com/resources/issue.html#journals>`__ for details, requires Redmine >= 5.0.0)\n\n**Changes**:\n\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* Switched to pytest instead of nose as nose project is dead\n  (`Issue #312 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/312>`__)\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed usage of distutils.LooseVersion internally since it became deprecated and\n  caused warnings, because of that all version info internally is now being represented as tuples and not strings\n  as before\n\n**Bugfixes**:\n\n- Stop raising `ResourceAttrError` for attributes that actually exist, but their value is `None`\n  (`Issue #261 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/pull/261>`__)\n- *Pro Edition:* RedmineUP Deal resource

support for special characters in WikiPage titles (`Issue #222 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/\n  issues/222>`__) (thanks to `Radek Czajka <https://github.com/rczajka>`__)\n- Added ``return_response`` and ``ignore_response`` parameters to engine which allow to skip response processing\n  and speed up the create/update/delete operation in case response body isn't needed (see\n  `docs <https://python-redmine.com/advanced/request_engines.html#session>`__ for details)\n\n**Bugfixes**:\n\n- User's ``send_information`` field wasn't sent correctly to Redmine so account information

2.6 and 3.3 support as they're not supported by Requests anymore\n\n**Improvements**:\n\n- ``PerformanceWarning`` will be issued when Python-Redmine does some unnecessary work under the hood to fix the\n  clients code problems\n\n**Bugfixes**:\n\n- ``Redmine.upload()`` fails under certain circumstances when used with a file-like object and it contains unicode\n  instead of bytes (`Issue #216 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/216>`__)\n- ``Redmine.session()`` doesn't restore previous engine if fails (`Issue #211 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/\n

(2018-05-02)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis release concentrates mostly on stability and adds small features here and there. Some of them\nare backwards incompatible and are marked as such. They shouldn't affect many users since most of\nthem were used internally by Python-Redmine. A support for the Files API has been finally added, but\nplease be sure to check its documentation as the implementation on the Redmine side is horrible and\nthere are things to keep in mind while working with Files API. Lastly, only until the end of May 2018\nthere is a chance to buy a Pro Edition for only 14.99$ instead of the usual 24.99$, this is your\nchance to get an edition with additional features for a good price and to support the further development\nof Python-Redmine, more info `here <https://python-redmine.com/editions.html#pro-edition>`_.\n\n**New Features**:\n\n- Files API support (`Issue #117 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/117>`__)\n\n**Improvements**:\n\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* ResourceSet's ``filter()`` method became more advanced. It is now possible\n  to filter on all available resource attributes, to follow resource relationships and apply lookups to\n  the filters (see `docs <https://python-redmine.com/introduction.html#methods>`__ for details)\n- ResourceManager class has been refactored:\n\n  * ``manager_class`` attribute on the ``Resource`` class can now be used to assign a separate\n    ``ResourceManager`` to a resource, that allows outsourcing a resource specific functionality to a\n    separate manager class (see ``WikiPageManager`` as an example)\n  * *Backwards Incompatible:* ``request()`` method has been removed\n  * ``_construct_*_url()``, ``_prepare_*_request()``, ``_process_*_response()`` methods have been added\n    for create, update and delete methods to allow a fine-grained control over these operations\n\n- Ability to upload file-like objects (`Issue #186 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/\n  186>`__) (thanks to `hjpotter92 <https://github.com/hjpotter92>`__)\n- Support for retrieving project's time entry activities (see `docs <https://python-redmine.com/resources/\n  project.html#get>`__ for details)\n- Attachment ``update()`` operation support (requires Redmine >= 3.4.0)\n- ``Resource.save()`` now accepts ``**attrs`` that need to be changed/set and returns ``self`` instead of a\n  boolean ``True``, which makes it chainable, so you can now do something like ``project.save(name='foo',\n  description='bar').export('txt', '/home/foo')``\n- ``get`` operation support for News, Query, Enumeration, IssueStatus, Tracker, CustomField, ContactTag,\n  DealStatus, DealCategory and CRMQuery resources\n- ``include`` param in ``get``, ``all`` and ``filter`` operations now accepts lists and tuples instead of\n  comma-separated string which is still accepted for backward compatibility reasons, i.e. one can use\n  ``include=['foo', 'bar']`` instead of ``include='foo,bar'``\n- It is now possible to use ``None`` and ``0`` in addition to ``''`` in ``assigned_to_id`` attribute in\n  Issue resource if an assignee needs to be removed from an issue\n\n**Changes**:\n\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* Issue ``all`` operation now really returns all issues, i.e. both open and closed,\n  instead of only returning open issues in previous versions due to the respect to Redmine's standard behaviour\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* Instead of only returning a token string, ``upload()`` method was modified to return\n  a dict that contains all the data for an upload returned from Redmine, i.e. id and token for Redmine >= 3.4.0,\n  token only for Redmine < 3.4.0. Also it is now possible to use this token and pass it using a ``token`` key\n  instead of the ``path`` key with path to the file in ``uploads`` parameter when doing an upload, this gives\n  more control over the uploading process if needed\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed ``resource_paths`` argument from Redmine object since ``ResourceManager``\n  now uses a special resource registry, to which, all resources that inherit from any Python-Redmine resource\n  are being automatically added\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed ``container_many`` in favor of ``container_filter``, ``container_create``\n  and ``container_update`` attributes on ``Resource`` object to allow more fine-grained resource setup\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* ``return_raw`` parameter on ``engine.request()`` and ``engine.process_response()``\n  methods has been removed in favor of ``return_raw_response`` attribute on engine object\n- Updated bundled requests library to v2.15.1\n\n**Bugfixes**:\n\n- Support 204 status code when deleting a resource (`Issue #189 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/\n  pull/189>`__) (thanks to `dotSlashLu <https://github.com/dotSlashLu>`__)\n- Raise ``ValidationError`` instead of not helpful ``TypeError`` exception when trying to create a WikiPage\n  resource that already exists (`Issue #182 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/182>`__)\n- Enumeration, Version, Group and Notes ``custom_fields`` attribute was returned as a list of dicts instead\n  of being converted to ``ResourceSet`` object\n- Downloads were downloaded fully into memory instead of being streamed as needed\n- ``ResourceRequirementsError`` exception was broken since v2.0.0\n- *Pro Edition:* RedmineUP CRM Contact and Deal resources export functionality didn't work\n- *Pro Edition:* RedmineUP CRM Contact and Deal resources sometimes weren't converted to Resource objects using Search API\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- Mentioned support for ``generate_password`` and ``send_information`` in User's resource create/update\n  methods, ``status`` in User's resource update method, ``parent_id`` in Issue's filter method and ``include``\n  in Issue's all method\n\n2.0.2 (2017-04-19)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n**Bugfixes**:\n\n- Filter doesn't work when there are > 100 resources requested (`Issue #175 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/\n  python-redmine/pull/175>`__) (thanks to `niwatolli3 <https://github.com/niwatolli3>`__)\n\n2.0.1 (2017-04-10)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\n- Fix PyPI package\n\n2.0.0 (2017-04-10)\n++++++++++++++++++\n\nThis version brings a lot of new features and changes, some of them are backward-incompatible, so please\nlook carefully at the changelog below to find out what needs to be changed in your code to make it work\nwith this version. Also Python-Redmine now comes in 2 editions: Standard and Pro, please have a look at\nthis `document <https://python-redmine.com/editions.html>`__ for more details. Documentation was\nalso significantly rewritten, so it is recommended to reread it even if you are an experienced Python-Redmine\nuser.\n\n**New Features**:\n\n- *Pro Edition:* RedmineUP `Checklist plugin <https://www.redmineup.com/pages/plugins/checklists>`__ support\n- `Request Engines <https://python-redmine.com/advanced/request_engines.html>`__ support. It is\n  now possible to create engines to define how requests to Redmine are made, e.g. synchronous (one by one)\n  or asynchronous using threads or processes etc\n- ``redmine.session()`` context manager which allows to temporary redefine engine's behaviour\n- Search API support (`Issue #138 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/138>`__)\n- Export functionality (`Issue #58 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/58>`__)\n- REDMINE_USE_EXTERNAL_REQUESTS environmental variable for emergency cases which allows to use external\n  requests instead of bundled one even if external requests version is lower than the bundled one\n- Wrong HTTP protocol usage detector, e.g. one use HTTP when HTTPS should be used\n\n**Improvements**:\n\n- ResourceSet objects were completely rewritten:\n\n  * ``ResourceSet`` object that was already sliced now supports reslicing\n  * ``ResourceSet`` object's ``delete()``, ``update()``, ``filter()`` and ``get()`` methods have been\n    optimized for speed\n  * ``ResourceSet`` object's ``delete()`` and ``update()`` methods now call the corresponding Resource's\n    ``pre_*()`` and ``post_*()`` methods\n  * ``ResourceSet`` object's ``get()`` and ``filter()`` methods now supports non-integer id's, e.g.\n    WikiPage's title can now be used with it\n  * *Backwards Incompatible:* ``ValuesResourceSet`` class has been removed\n  * *Backwards Incompatible:* ``ResourceSet.values()`` method now returns an iterable of dicts instead of\n    ``ValuesResourceSet`` object\n  * ``ResourceSet.values_list()`` method has been added which returns an iterable of tuples with Resource\n    values or single values if flattened, i.e. ``flat=True``\n\n- New ``Resource`` object methods:\n\n  * ``delete()`` deletes current resource from Redmine\n  * ``pre_delete()`` and ``post_delete()`` can be used to execute tasks that should be done before/after\n    deleting the resource through ``delete()`` method\n  * ``bulk_decode()``, ``bulk_encode()``, ``decode()`` and ``encode()`` which are used to translate\n    attributes of the resource to/from Python/Redmine\n\n- Attachment ``delete()`` method support (requires Redmine >= 3.3.0)\n- *Pro Edition:* RedmineUP CRM Note resource now provides ``type`` attribute which shows text representation of ``type_id``\n- *Pro Edition:* RedmineUP CRM DealStatus resource now provides ``status`` attribute which shows text representation of\n  ``status_type``\n- WikiPage resource now provides ``project_id`` attribute\n- Unicode handling was significantly rewritten and shouldn't cause any more troubles\n- ``UnknownError`` exception now contains ``status_code`` attribute which can be used to handle the\n  exception instead of parsing code from exception's text\n- Sync engine's speed improved to 8-12% depending on the amount of resources fetched\n\n**Changes**:\n\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* Renamed package name from ``redmine`` to ``redminelib``\n- Resource class attributes that were previously tuples are now lists\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* ``_Resource`` class renamed to ``Resource``\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* ``Redmine.custom_resource_paths`` keyword argument renamed to ``resource_paths``\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* ``Redmine.download()`` method now returns a `requests.Response\n  <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/api/#requests.Response>`__ object directly instead of\n  ``iter_content()`` method if a ``savepath`` param wasn't provided, this gives user even more control over\n  response data\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* ``Resource.refresh()`` now really refreshes itself instead of returning a new\n  refreshed resource, to get the previous behaviour use ``itself`` param, e.g. ``Resource.refresh(itself=False)``\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed Python 3.2 support\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed ``container_filter``, ``container_create`` and ``container_update`` attributes\n  on ``Resource`` object in favor of ``container_many`` attribute\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed ``Resource.translate_params()`` and ``ResourceManager.prepare_params()`` in\n  favor of ``Resource.bulk_decode()``\n- *Backwards Incompatible:* Removed ``is_unicode()``, ``is_string()`` and ``to_string()`` from\n  ``redminelib.utilities``\n- Updated bundled requests library to v2.13.0\n\n**Bugfixes**:\n\n- Infinite loop when uploading zero-length files (`Issue #152 <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/\n  issues/152>`__)\n- Unsupported Redmine resource error while trying to use Python-Redmine without installation (`Issue #156\n  <https://github.com/maxtepkeev/python-redmine/issues/156>`__)\n- It was impossible to set ``data``, ``params`` and ``headers`` via ``requests`` keyword argument on\n  Redmine object\n- Calling ``str()`` or ``repr()`` on a Resource was giving incorrect results if exception raising\n  was turned off for a resource\n\n**Documentation**:\n\n- Switched to the alabaster theme\n- Added new sections:\n\n  * `Editions <https://python-redmine.com/editions.html>`__\n  * `Introduction <https://python-redmine.com/introduction.html>`__\n  * `Request Engines
