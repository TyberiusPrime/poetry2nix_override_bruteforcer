Simply pass it a list of policies that\nshould be tried in order::\n\n\n    policies = [\n        IPAuthenticationPolicy(\"127.0.*.*\", principals=[\"local\"])\n        IPAuthenticationPolicy(\"192.168.*.*\", principals=[\"trusted\"])\n    ]\n    authn_policy = MultiAuthenticationPolicy(policies)\n    config.set_authentication_policy(authn_policy)\n\nThis example uses the pyramid_ipauth module to assign effective principals\nbased on originating IP address of the request.  It combines two such\npolicies so that requests originating from \"127.0.*.*\" will have principal\n\"local\" while requests originating from \"192.168.*.*\" will have principal\n\"trusted\".\n\nIn general, the results from the stacked authentication policies are combined\nas follows:\n\n    * authenticated_userid:    return userid from first successful policy\n    * unauthenticated_userid:  return userid from first successful policy\n    * effective_principals:    return union of principals from all policies\n    * remember:                return headers from all policies\n    * forget:                  return headers from all policies\n\n\nDeployment Settings\n===================\n\nIt is also possible to specify the authentication policies as part of your\npaste deployment settings.  Consider the following example::\n\n    [app:pyramidapp]\n    use = egg:mypyramidapp\n\n    multiauth.policies = ipauth1 ipauth2 pyramid_browserid\n\n    multiauth.policy.ipauth1.use = pyramid_ipauth.IPAuthentictionPolicy\n    multiauth.policy.ipauth1.ipaddrs = 127.0.*.*\n    multiauth.policy.ipauth1.principals = local\n\n    multiauth.policy.ipauth2.use = pyramid_ipauth.IPAuthentictionPolicy\n    multiauth.policy.ipauth2.ipaddrs = 192.168.*.*\n    multiauth.policy.ipauth2.principals = trusted\n\nTo configure authentication from these settings, simply include the multiauth\nmodule into your configurator::\n\n    config.include(\"pyramid_multiauth\")\n\nIn this example you would get a MultiAuthenticationPolicy with three stacked\nauth policies.  The first two, ipauth1 and ipauth2, are defined as the name of\nof a callable along with a set of keyword arguments.  The third is defined as\nthe name of a module, pyramid_browserid, which will be processed via the\nstandard config.include() mechanism.\n\nThe end result would be a system that authenticates users via BrowserID, and\nassigns additional principal identifiers based on the originating IP address\nof the request.\n\nIf necessary, the *group finder function* and the *authorization policy* can\nalso be specified from configuration::\n\n    [app:pyramidapp]\n    use = egg:mypyramidapp\n\n    multiauth.authorization_policy = mypyramidapp.acl.Custom\n    multiauth.groupfinder  = mypyramidapp.acl.groupfinder\n\n    ...\n\n\nMultiAuthPolicySelected Event\n=============================\n\nAn event is triggered when one of the multiple policies configured is selected.\n\n::\n\n    from pyramid_multiauth import MultiAuthPolicySelected\n\n\n    # Track policy used, for prefixing user_id and for logging.\n    def on_policy_selected(event):\n        print(\"%s (%s) authenticated %s for request %s\" % (event.policy_name,\n                                                           event.policy,\n                                                           event.userid,\n                                                           event.request))\n\n    config.add_subscriber(on_policy_selected, MultiAuthPolicySelected)\n","description_content_type":"text/x-rst","docs_url":null,"download_url":null,"downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":null,"keywords":"web pyramid pylons authentication","license":"Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 ==================================  1.

Distribution of Source Form  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).  3.4.
