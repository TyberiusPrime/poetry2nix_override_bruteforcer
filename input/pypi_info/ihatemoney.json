This API recently\nstarted requiring an API key, and this broke I Hate Money in many ways.\n\nThis release adds a set of workarounds for this issue.  This should restore\nbasic functionality such as adding bills.  However, we had to disable\nsome operations to prevent crashing:\n\n- Setting or changing the default currency on an existing project is no longer possible.\n  However, setting a project to \"No currency\" is still possible.\n- Adding or editing a bill with a currency that differs from the default currency\n  of the project is no longer possible\n\n[Longer-term solutions are being discussed](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/issues/1232).\nIf you are using currencies in your projects, your input is welcome.\n\n### Added\n\n- Simplifies adding a bill with keyboard only (#1221)\n- Add details of bills in history (#1223)\n- Remember last \"For whom?\" field when adding a new bill (#1222)\n- Speed up unit tests (#1214)\n- Update translations for Spanish, Russian, Kannada, Swedish, Polish, German, and Italian\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix remembering the last selected payer when switching project (#1224)\n\n\n## 6.1.0 (2023-07-29)\n\n### Added\n- Add RSS feed for each project (#1158)\n- Security: require private code to edit a project settings (#1204)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix 404 page crash (#1201)\n\n\n## 6.0.1 (2023-07-22)\n\n### Added\n- Add support for `APPLICATION_ROOT` in Docker container (#1189)\n- Improve docker-compose example: admin password and volume for database (#1169)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix docker-compose example quoting (#1164)\n- Fix crash when using existing sessions (migrate them to dict) (#1194)\n- Add newly created projects to the list of projects (#1193)\n\n\n## 6.0.0 (2023-07-13)\n\n### Breaking changes\n- Drop Python 3.6 support\n- Add Python 3.11 support\n\nThe minimum supported version is now Python 3.7, and the project is\ntested with up to Python 3.11\n\n### Added\n- Enable new languages: Catalan, Czech, Spanish, Persian, Hebrew, Hungarian, Kannada, Serbian, Telugu, Thai\n- Build ARM64 and ARMv7 Docker image (#1141)\n- Allow bills with an amount of zero (#1133)\n- Add confirmation for expense deletion (#1096)\n- Display a QR code when inviting people (#1000)\n- Add a cancel button when editing a bill for better UX (#1013)\n\n### Fixed\n- Fix project deletion in the dashboard (#1094)\n- Fix duplicate project name in dropdown list (#1082)\n- Fix captcha validation, it should be case insensitive on both side (#1061)\n- Fix CSRF on logout (#1040)\n- Fix XSS when inviting people by email (#1044)\n\n### Changed\n- Use a better quality favicon (#1102)\n- Use Flask-Limiter to implement rate limiting (#1054)\n\n## 5.2.0 (2022-04-07)\n\n### Added\n\n- Make docker image production-ready: support PostgreSQL, allow customizing port, PUID, PGID (#919)\n- List supported currencies in API under api/currencies (#961)\n- Allow to import bills in CSV format, compatible with Cospend (#951)\n  Note that there is a [known issue with this new feature](https://github.com/spiral-project/ihatemoney/issues/980)\n\n### New settings\n\n- Add [SHOW_ADMIN_EMAIL](https://ihatemoney.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#show-admin-email)\n  setting (#965)\n\n### Changed settings\n\n- [MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER](https://ihatemoney.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#mail-default-sender)\n  is now a string instead of a tuple.
