This library performs merges at a character level, as opposed to most VCS systems, which opt for a line-based approach.\n\n\n## Installing\nTo install three-merge, you can use both conda or pip package managers:\n\n```bash\n# Using conda (Recommended)\nconda install three-merge -c spyder-ide\n\n# Using pip\npip install three-merge\n```\n\n## Dependencies\nThis package depends on [diff-match-patch](https://github.com/google/diff-match-patch) to compute and track the differences across the source and target strings with respect to the base one.\n\n## Installing locally\nTo install and develop three-merge locally, you will need to install diff-match-patch:\n\n```bash\n# Using conda\nconda install diff-match-patch\n\n# Using pip\npip install diff-match-patch\n```\n\nThen, you can install the package locally using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install -U -e .\n```\n\n## Running tests\nWe use pytest to run tests as it follows:\n\n```bash\npytest -x -v three_merge/tests\n```\n\n## Package usage\nThree-merge provides a ``merge`` function to merge changes from two strings (source, target) with respect a original string (base). This library is able to handle additions, deletions and preserved sections across both strings, while detecting and highlighting possible merge conflicts (like Git).\n\n```python\n# Package import\nfrom three_merge import merge\n\n# Strings have non-conflicting additions\nbase = '123456789101112'\nsource = '0123456789101112'\ntarget = '12345678910111213'\n\n# merged = '012345678910111213'\nmerged = merge(source, target, base)\n\n# Strings have an addition conflict\nbase = '123456789101112'\nsource = '123a456789101112'\ntarget = '123b456789101112'\n\n# merged = '123<<<<<<< ++ a ======= ++ b >>>>>>>456789101112'\nmerged = merge(source, target, base)\n\n# Strings have non-conflicting addition/deletions\nbase = '123456789101112'\nsource = '123456789ab101112'\ntarget = '123789101112'\n\n# merged = '123789ab101112'\nmerged = merge(source, target, base)\n```\n\nFor more examples, please take a look at our [tests](https://github.com/spyder-ide/three-merge/blob/master/three_merge/tests/test_merge.py).\n\n\n## Changelog\nPlease see our [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/spyder-ide/three-merge/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) file to learn more about our new features and improvements.\n\n\n## Contribution guidelines\nWe follow PEP8 and PEP257 for all Python modules. We use MyPy type annotations for all functions and classes declared on this package. Feel free to send a PR or create an issue if you have any problem/question.\n\n\n\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/spyder-ide/three-merge","keywords":"Merge,Files,Three-way","license":"MIT","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"three-merge","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/three-merge/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/three-merge/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://github.com/spyder-ide/three-merge"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/three-merge/0.1.1/","requires_dist":["diff-match-patch","pytest ;
