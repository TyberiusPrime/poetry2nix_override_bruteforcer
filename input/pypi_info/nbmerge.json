After collection, it sorts them\nlexicographically. You can use a regular expression as a file name\npredicate. All ``.ipynb_checkpoints`` are automatically ignored. And, you\ncan use the ``-i`` option to ignore any notebook prefixed with an underscore\n(think pseudo-private in python). \n\nFor example, the following command collects all notebooks in your project\nthat have the word ``intro`` in the file name and saves it to a merged file\nnamed ``_merged.ipynb``,\n\n.. code:: sh\n\n    nbmerge --recursive -i -p \".*intro.*\" -o _merged.ipynb\n\nFinally, you can also instruct the script to demarcate the boundary\nbetween each original file with the ``-b`` / ``-boundary [BOUNDARY]`` flag.\nThe ``src_nb`` value in the metadata for the first cell in each original\nnotebook will then contain the path of the original notebook, relative to\nthe cwd at the point of script execution.\n\nLineage\n=======\n\n`@fperez <https://github.com/fperez>`__ wrote an\n`nbmerge.py <https://gist.github.com/fperez/e2bbc0a208e82e450f69>`__\nscript which \"Merge[s]/concatenate[s] multiple IPython notebooks into\none.\" I use it a lot. Evidently, `other people do,\ntoo <https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=nbmerge.py&type=Code>`__.\nIn early 2016, he opened an `issue to add the script as an nbconvert\ntool <https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/issues/253>`__, but nothing\ncame of it. However, he and `@Carreau <https://github.com/carreau>`__ came up\nwith good (i.e. unsurprising) `semantics for metadata merging and\nnotebook\nnaming <https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/issues/253#issuecomment-187492911>`__:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    metadata = {}\n    for n in reversed(notebooks):\n        metadata.update(n.metadata)\n\n\nI don't think it's possible to implement the merger as a preprocessor.\nPreprocessors are stateless, so you can't implement a reduce operation.\nInstead, I wrote (er, packaged up) this library as an\n`nbstripoutput <https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout>`__-like package . \nIt fits in a ``Makefile`` script just fine. \n\nRight now, only the basic (originally fperez's) functionality is \nimplemented. However, I'm going to follow \n`kynan's <https://github.com/kynan>`__ lead and slowly pull in functionality\nsimilar to his ``nbstripout`` package.\n\n","description_content_type":null,"docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/jbn/nbmerge","keywords":"jupyter","license":"MIT","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"nbmerge","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/nbmerge/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/nbmerge/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://github.com/jbn/nbmerge"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/nbmerge/0.0.4/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":"","summary":"A
