The models were pre-trained on the freely available [MUSDB18](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html) dataset. See details at [apply pre-trained model](#getting-started).\n\n## ‚≠êÔ∏è News \n\n- 03/07/2021: We added `umxl`, a model that was trained on extra data which significantly improves the performance, especially generalization.\n- 14/02/2021: We released the new version of open-unmix as a python package. This comes with: a fully differentiable version of [norbert](https://github.com/sigsep/norbert), improved audio loading pipeline and large number of bug fixes. See [release notes](https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-pytorch/releases/) for further info.\n\n- 06/05/2020: We added a pre-trained speech enhancement model `umxse` provided by Sony.\n\n- 13/03/2020: Open-unmix was awarded 2nd place in the [PyTorch Global Summer Hackathon 2020](https://devpost.com/software/open-unmix).\n\n__Related Projects:__ open-unmix-pytorch | [open-unmix-nnabla](https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-nnabla) | [musdb](https://github.com/sigsep/sigsep-mus-db) | [museval](https://github.com/sigsep/sigsep-mus-eval) | [norbert](https://github.com/sigsep/norbert)\n\n## üß† The Model (for one source)\n\n![](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vTPoQiPwmdfET4pZhue1RvG7oEUJz7eUeQvCu6vzYeKRwHl6by4RRTnphImSKM0k5KXw9rZ1iIFnpGW/pub?w=959&h=308)\n\nTo perform separation into multiple sources, _Open-unmix_ comprises multiple models that are trained for each particular target. While this makes the training less comfortable, it allows great flexibility to customize the training data for each target source.\n\nEach _Open-Unmix_ source model is based on a three-layer bidirectional deep LSTM. The model learns to predict the magnitude spectrogram of a target source, like _vocals_, from the magnitude spectrogram of a mixture input. Internally, the prediction is obtained by applying a mask on the input. The model is optimized in the magnitude domain using mean squared error.\n\n### Input Stage\n\n__Open-Unmix__ operates in the time-frequency domain to perform its prediction. The input of the model is either:\n\n* __`models.Separator`:__ A time domain signal tensor of shape `(nb_samples, nb_channels, nb_timesteps)`, where `nb_samples` are the samples in a batch, `nb_channels` is 1 or 2 for mono or stereo audio, respectively, and `nb_timesteps` is the number of audio samples in the recording. In this case, the model computes STFTs with either `torch` or `asteroid_filteranks` on the fly.\n\n* __`models.OpenUnmix`:__ The core open-unmix takes **magnitude spectrograms** directly (e.g. when pre-computed and loaded from disk). In that case, the input is of shape `(nb_frames, nb_samples, nb_channels, nb_bins)`, where `nb_frames` and `nb_bins` are the time and frequency-dimensions of a Short-Time-Fourier-Transform.\n\nThe input spectrogram is _standardized_ using the global mean and standard deviation for every frequency bin across all frames. Furthermore, we apply batch normalization in multiple stages of the model to make the training more robust against gain variation.\n\n### Dimensionality reduction\n\nThe LSTM is not operating on the original input spectrogram resolution. Instead, in the first step after the normalization, the network learns to compresses the frequency and channel axis of the model to reduce redundancy and make the model converge faster.\n\n### Bidirectional-LSTM\n\nThe core of __open-unmix__ is a three layer bidirectional [LSTM network](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1246450). Due to its recurrent nature, the model can be trained and evaluated on arbitrary length of audio signals. Since the model takes information from past and future simultaneously, the model cannot be used in an online/real-time manner.\nAn uni-directional model can easily be trained as described [here](docs/training.md).\n\n### Output Stage\n\nAfter applying the LSTM, the signal is decoded back to its original input dimensionality. In the last steps the output is multiplied with the input magnitude spectrogram, so that the models is asked to learn a mask.\n\n## ü§π‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Putting source models together: the `Separator`\n\n`models.Separator` puts together _Open-unmix_ spectrogram model for each desired target, and combines their output through a multichannel generalized Wiener filter, before application of inverse STFTs using `torchaudio`.\nThe filtering is differentiable (but parameter-free) version of [norbert](https://github.com/sigsep/norbert). The separator is currently currently only used during inference.\n\n## üèÅ Getting started\n\n### Installation\n\n`openunmix` can be installed from pypi using:\n\n```\npip install openunmix\n```\n\nNote, that the pypi version of openunmix uses [torchaudio] to load and save audio files. To increase the number of supported input and output file formats (such as STEMS export), please additionally install [stempeg](https://github.com/faroit/stempeg).\n\nTraining is not part of the open-unmix package, please follow [docs/train.md] for more information.\n\n#### Using Docker\n\nWe also provide a docker container. Performing separation of a local track in `~/Music/track1.wav` can be performed in a single line:\n\n```\ndocker run -v ~/Music/:/data -it faroit/open-unmix-pytorch \"/data/track1.wav\" --outdir /data/track1\n```\n\n### Pre-trained models\n\nWe provide three core pre-trained music separation models. All three models are end-to-end models that take waveform inputs and output the separated waveforms.\n\n* __`umxl` (default)__  trained on private stems dataset of compressed stems. __Note, that the weights are only licensed for non-commercial use (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).__\n\n  [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.5069601.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5069601)\n\n* __`umxhq`__  trained on [MUSDB18-HQ](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html#uncompressed-wav) which comprises the same tracks as in MUSDB18 but un-compressed which yield in a full bandwidth of 22050 Hz.\n\n  [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3370489.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3370489)\n\n* __`umx`__ is trained on the regular [MUSDB18](https://sigsep.github.io/datasets/musdb.html#compressed-stems) which is bandwidth limited to 16 kHz do to AAC compression. This model should be used for comparison with other (older) methods for evaluation in [SiSEC18](sisec18.unmix.app).\n\n  [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3370486.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3370486)\n\nFurthermore, we provide a model for speech enhancement trained by [Sony Corporation](link)\n\n* __`umxse`__ speech enhancement model is trained on the 28-speaker version of the [Voicebank+DEMAND corpus](https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/1942?show=full).\n\n  [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.3786908.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3786908)\n\nAll four models are also available as spectrogram (core) models, which take magnitude spectrogram inputs and ouput separated spectrograms.\nThese models can be loaded using `umxl_spec`, `umxhq_spec`, `umx_spec` and `umxse_spec`.\n\nTo separate audio files (`wav`, `flac`, `ogg` - but not `mp3`) files just run:\n\n```bash\numx input_file.wav\n```\n\nA more detailed list of the parameters used for the separation is given in the [inference.md](/docs/inference.md) document.\n\nWe provide a [jupyter notebook on google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1mijF0zGWxN-KaxTnd0q6hayAlrID5fEQ) to experiment with open-unmix and to separate files online without any installation setup.\n\n### Using pre-trained models from within python\n\nWe implementes several ways to load pre-trained models and use them from within your python projects:\n#### When the package is installed\n\nLoading a pre-trained models is as simple as loading\n\n```python\nseparator = openunmix.umxl(...)\n```\n#### torch.hub\n\nWe also provide a torch.hub compatible modules that can be loaded. Note that this does _not_ even require to install the open-unmix packagen and should generally work when the pytorch version is the same.\n\n```python\nseparator = torch.hub.load('sigsep/open-unmix-pytorch', 'umxl, device=device)\n```\n\nWhere, `umxl` specifies the pre-trained model. \n#### Performing separation\n\nWith a created separator object, one can perform separation of some `audio` (torch.Tensor of shape `(channels, length)`, provided as at a sampling rate `separator.sample_rate`) through:\n\n```python\nestimates = separator(audio, ...)\n# returns estimates as tensor\n```\n\nNote that this requires the audio to be in the right shape and sampling rate. For convenience we provide a pre-processing in `openunmix.utils.preprocess(..`)` that takes numpy audio and converts it to be used for open-unmix.\n\n#### One-liner\n\nTo perform model loading, preprocessing and separation in one step, just use:\n\n```python\nfrom openunmix.predict import separate\nestimates = separate(audio, ...)\n```\n\n### Load user-trained models\n\nWhen a path instead of a model-name is provided to `--model`, pre-trained `Separator` will be loaded from disk.\nE.g. The following files are assumed to present when loading `--model mymodel --targets vocals`\n\n* `mymodel/separator.json`\n* `mymodel/vocals.pth`\n* `mymodel/vocals.json`\n\n\nNote that the separator usually joins multiple models for each target and performs separation using all models. E.g. if the separator contains `vocals` and `drums` models, two output files are generated, unless the `--residual` option is selected, in which case an additional source will be produced, containing an estimate of all that is not the targets in the mixtures.\n\n### Evaluation using `museval`\n\nTo perform evaluation in comparison to other SISEC systems, you would need to install the `museval` package using\n\n```\npip install museval\n```\n\nand then run the evaluation using\n\n`python -m openunmix.evaluate --outdir /path/to/musdb/estimates --evaldir /path/to/museval/results`\n\n### Results compared to SiSEC 2018 (SDR/Vocals)\n\nOpen-Unmix yields state-of-the-art results compared to participants from [SiSEC 2018](https://sisec18.unmix.app/#/methods). The performance of `UMXHQ` and `UMX` is almost identical since it was evaluated on compressed STEMS.\n\n![boxplot_updated](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72940/63944652-3f624c80-ca72-11e9-8d33-bed701679fe6.png)\n\nNote that\n\n1. [`STL1`, `TAK2`, `TAK3`, `TAU1`, `UHL3`, `UMXHQ`] were omitted as they were _not_ trained on only _MUSDB18_.\n2. [`HEL1`, `TAK1`, `UHL1`, `UHL2`] are not open-source.\n\n#### Scores (Median of frames, Median of tracks)\n\n|target|SDR  | SDR |  SDR |\n|------|-----|-----|-----|\n|`model`|UMX  |UMXHQ|UMXL |\n|vocals|6.32 | 6.25|__7.21__ |\n|bass  |5.23 | 5.07|__6.02__ |\n|drums |5.73 | 6.04|__7.15__ |\n|other |4.02 | 4.28|__4.89__ |\n\n## Training\n\nDetails on the training is provided in a separate document [here](docs/training.md).\n\n## Extensions\n\nDetails on how _open-unmix_ can be extended or improved for future research on music separation is described in a separate document [here](docs/extensions.md).\n\n\n## Design Choices\n\nwe favored simplicity over performance to promote clearness of the code. The rationale is to have __open-unmix__ serve as a __baseline__ for future research while performance still meets current state-of-the-art (See [Evaluation](#Evaluation)). The results are comparable/better to those of `UHL1`/`UHL2` which obtained the best performance over all systems trained on MUSDB18 in the [SiSEC 2018 Evaluation campaign](https://sisec18.unmix.app).\nWe designed the code to allow researchers to reproduce existing results, quickly develop new architectures and add own user data for training and testing. We favored framework specifics implementations instead of having a monolithic repository with common code for all frameworks.\n\n## How to contribute\n\n_open-unmix_ is a community focused project, we therefore encourage the community to submit bug-fixes and requests for technical support through [github issues](https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-pytorch/issues/new/choose).
