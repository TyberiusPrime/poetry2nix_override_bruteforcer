Compatibility is intended to match only the latest public,\nnon-deprecated importlib API.\n\nNote: This project is not yet released and the code base may be\nunstable.  Currently the importlib tests all pass, but a few things\nremain to be done before the initial release.\n\nNote: Currently there is a problem under Python 3.2 with loading\nmodules from .pyc files.  However, this does not affect 2.7, which is\nthe main target for importlib2.\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nYou may use ``importlib2`` as you would any other module.  You may also\ncall ``importlib2.hook.install()`` to make Python use ``importlib2`` for\nthe import system.\n\n\nAPI\n---\n\nSee https://docs.python.org/dev/library/importlib.html.\n\nBe aware that deprecated importlib APIs have not been backported.\n\n\nBuilding and Installing\n-----------------------\n\nUse setup.py/pip/setuptools like normal.\n\n\nExtra Files\n-----------\n\n``importlib2`` adds the following files to ``importlib`` (relative to\npackage's root directory):\n\n* ``_fixers/`` - the code used to monkeypatch importlib2 at run-time\n* ``_version/__init__.py`` - contains the ``importlib2`` version\n   information\n* ``_version/ORIGINAL_PY_VERSION`` - the major/minor/micro version of the\n   cpython from which ``importlib2`` was most recently pulled\n* ``_version/ORIGINAL_PY_REVISION`` - the revision of the cpython repo\n   from which ``importlib2`` was most recently pulled\n* ``_version/RELEASE`` - the ``importlib2`` release identifier relative\n   to ``ORIGINAL_PY_VERSION`` (an increasing integer)\n   from which ``importlib2`` was most recently pulled\n* ``hook.py`` - the module used to set ``importlib2`` as Python's import\n   system (not in the ``clean-cpython`` branch)\n\n\nTools\n-----\n\nEach is located in the project root.\n\n* ``pull-cpython.py`` (only in the ``clean-cpython`` branch)\n* ``tests/`` (run ``python -m tests``)\n\n\nMain Branches\n-------------\n\n* ``clean-cpython`` - the relevant importlib files pulled from a cpython\n   repo\n* ``standalone-3.4`` - the files fixed so that the test suite passes\n   using the Python interpreter built from the same cpython repo\n* ``default`` - the files fixed to work under 2.7\n\nReleases are made from the default branch.\n\n\nMerging from cpython\n--------------------\n\n1. from the ``clean-cpython`` branch run ``pull-cpython.py``\n2. commit the change\n3. change to the ``standalone-3.4`` branch\n4. merge from the ``clean-cpython`` branch\n5. make any changes necessary to get the test suite to pass using\n   the same cpython from which the files were most recently pulled\n6. commit the changes (if any)\n7. change to ``default``\n8. merge from the ``standalone-3.4`` branch\n9. make any changes necessary to get the test suite to pass using\n   Python 2.7 (and 3.2)\n10. commit the changes (if any)\n\n\nReleasing\n---------\n\n<TBD>\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nContributions are very welcome.  That said, my intent is that the\nproject start out stable and that the API mirror that of importlib as\nclosely as possible.  So if I've done things right there won't be much\nneed for contribution! :)\n\nRegardless, I'm definitely interested in bug reports and I'd be glad to\ntake any feedback.  If you have a patch, definitely send a pull request.\nIf you have any suggestions on improving the importlib API, you may open\na ticket in the project tracker, but your best bet would be to open an\nissue upstream on `Python's bug tracker`_ (add eric.snow and\nbrett.cannon to the nosy list).\n\n.. _Python's bug tracker:: https://bugs.python.org\n\n\nReporting Issues and Feedback\n-----------------------------\n\nYou may report bugs/suggestions/etc. issues to the project issue\ntracker:\n\nhttps://bitbucket.org/ericsnowcurrently/importlib2/issues\n\nIf that doesn't fit, you can either take the matter to the\nimport-sig@python.org `mailing list`_ or email me directly at\nericsnowcurrent@gmail.com.\n\n.. _mailing list: https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/import-sig\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nA special thanks goes to Brett Cannon who went through the painstaking\nwork of taking CPython's import machinery and turning it into a pure\nPython library, importlib.  His efforts over the course of several years\nbore fruit in Python 3.1 with the addition of importlib to the standard\nlibrary and culminated in the use of importlib as Python's import\nmachinery starting in Python 3.3.  Furthermore, without importlib's\nthorough test suite importlib2 would have been essentially infeasible.\nThanks Brett!","description_content_type":null,"docs_url":null,"download_url":"UNKNOWN","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://bitbucket.org/ericsnowcurrently/importlib2/","keywords":null,"license":"New BSD License","maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"name":"importlib2","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/importlib2/","platform":"UNKNOWN","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/importlib2/","project_urls":{"Download":"UNKNOWN","Homepage":"https://bitbucket.org/ericsnowcurrently/importlib2/"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/importlib2/3.5.0.2/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":null,"summary":"A backport of the Python 3 importlib package.","version":"3.5.0.2","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":1312210,"releases":{"3.5.0.0":[],"3.5.0.1":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"f2eee899f6144708262bcbe5567864be83c00fb5c5996fe91494f3a9e2939944","md5":"120da681d96e5b2b877491baf958a7e4","sha256":"f550c2619505810e3529b886c410964ef589e06f439607e3f2ffb882385f5e10"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"importlib2-3.5.0.1.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"120da681d96e5b2b877491baf958a7e4","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":52292,"upload_time":"2014-08-15T01:40:51","upload_time_iso_8601":"2014-08-15T01:40:51.786016Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f2/ee/e899f6144708262bcbe5567864be83c00fb5c5996fe91494f3a9e2939944/importlib2-3.5.0.1.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"3.5.0.2":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"b7a483cd23bc3a1a083d85ddcd4c09f5f243dc7d90b8257f4e44861b34ae42ec","md5":"ba7cb7cce363b2fa82c061dc05b06769","sha256":"e6a001143dcd6f1388a6c3b362a05206bd7e2d5aeaae8d12f22570b8bbd63964"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"importlib2-3.5.0.2.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"ba7cb7cce363b2fa82c061dc05b06769","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":55643,"upload_time":"2014-11-19T01:10:26","upload_time_iso_8601":"2014-11-19T01:10:26.379442Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b7/a4/83cd23bc3a1a083d85ddcd4c09f5f243dc7d90b8257f4e44861b34ae42ec/importlib2-3.5.0.2.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"b7a483cd23bc3a1a083d85ddcd4c09f5f243dc7d90b8257f4e44861b34ae42ec","md5":"ba7cb7cce363b2fa82c061dc05b06769","sha256":"e6a001143dcd6f1388a6c3b362a05206bd7e2d5aeaae8d12f22570b8bbd63964"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"importlib2-3.5.0.2.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"ba7cb7cce363b2fa82c061dc05b06769","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":55643,"upload_time":"2014-11-19T01:10:26","upload_time_iso_8601":"2014-11-19T01:10:26.379442Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/b7/a4/83cd23bc3a1a083d85ddcd4c09f5f243dc7d90b8257f4e44861b34ae42ec/importlib2-3.5.0.2.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
