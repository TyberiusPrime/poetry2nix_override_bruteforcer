Note that\nthe byte stream should have a sufficient amount of complexity.  For example,\na byte stream of identical bytes will not generate a hash value.\n\n## What's new in py-tlsh 4.5.0\nThis package was created as an unofficial fork, but is currently superceded by the official [py-tlsh](https://pypi.org/project/py-tlsh/)\npackage as of December 2020.\nThe improvements are:\n* fixed this package so that it works on Windows\n* compatibility with VirusTotal adoption of TLSH: updated to the T1 hash format with backwards compatibility for old hashes\n* fixed the q3=0 divide by zero bug [issue 79](https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh/issues/79)\n\n## Usage\n\n```python\nimport tlsh\n\ntlsh.hash(data)\n```\n\nNote data needs to be bytes - not a string.\nThis is because TLSH is for binary data and binary data can contain a NULL (zero) byte.\n\nIn default mode the data must contain at least 50 bytes to generate a hash value and that\nit must have a certain amount of randomness.\nTo get the hash value of a file, try\n\n```python\ntlsh.hash(open(file, 'rb').read())\n```\n\nNote: the open statement has opened the file in binary mode.\n\n## Example\n```python\nimport tlsh\n\nh1 = tlsh.hash(data)\nh2 = tlsh.hash(similar_data)\nscore = tlsh.diff(h1, h2)\n\nh3 = tlsh.Tlsh()\nwith open('file', 'rb') as f:\n    for buf in iter(lambda: f.read(512), b''):\n        h3.update(buf)\n    h3.final()\n# this assertion is stating that the distance between a TLSH and itself must be zero\nassert h3.diff(h3) == 0\nscore = h3.diff(h1)\n```\n\n## Extra Options\n\nThe `diffxlen` function removes the file length component of the tlsh header from the comparison.\n\n```python\ntlsh.diffxlen(h1, h2)\n```\n\nIf a file with a repeating pattern is compared to a file with only a single instance of the pattern,\nthen the difference will be increased if the file lenght is included.\nBut by using the `diffxlen` function, the file length will be removed from consideration.\n\n## Backwards Compatibility Options\n\nIf you use the \"conservative\" option, then the data must contain at least 256 characters.\nFor example,\n\n```python\nimport os\ntlsh.conservativehash(os.urandom(256))\n```\n\nshould generate a hash, but\n\n```python\ntlsh.conservativehash(os.urandom(100))\n```\n\nwill generate TNULL as it is less than 256 bytes.\n\nIf you need to generate old style hashes (without the \"T1\" prefix) then use\n\n```python\ntlsh.oldhash(os.urandom(100))\n```\n\n\nThe old and conservative options may be combined:\n\n```python\ntlsh.oldconservativehash(os.urandom(500))\n```","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh","keywords":"","license":"Apache or BSD","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"python-tlsh","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/python-tlsh/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/python-tlsh/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://github.com/trendmicro/tlsh"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/python-tlsh/4.5.0/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":">=3.6","summary":"TLSH (C++ Python extension)","version":"4.5.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":10655939,"releases":{"3.17.0":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"80eec2adc0b259c23472b355065d3ee34785bb186264fbcde88cce3f0754ce48","md5":"a252c75f14f71981a8540481680480c9","sha256":"daeab966d63fd87a5f3d341301b22952f28d72a06a4c71936123c4bb7fa5ae5a"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"python-tlsh-3.17.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"a252c75f14f71981a8540481680480c9","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":36246,"upload_time":"2019-12-03T08:43:10","upload_time_iso_8601":"2019-12-03T08:43:10.474049Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/80/ee/c2adc0b259c23472b355065d3ee34785bb186264fbcde88cce3f0754ce48/python-tlsh-3.17.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"4.5.0":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"a005921e95890f52cbcd2ebb5281ab0ed4f9b6039ba68d781927c9e4057dfc31","md5":"8b1b5c46272a5f97a5e6f0b05f2f0f24","sha256":"55e3df72cabdf48bf576b4580d7fa2feba9c14aacde0a8bd7b1ef40b03cb7969"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"python-tlsh-4.5.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"8b1b5c46272a5f97a5e6f0b05f2f0f24","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.6","size":40216,"upload_time":"2021-06-15T20:02:37","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-06-15T20:02:37.882742Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/a0/05/921e95890f52cbcd2ebb5281ab0ed4f9b6039ba68d781927c9e4057dfc31/python-tlsh-4.5.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"a005921e95890f52cbcd2ebb5281ab0ed4f9b6039ba68d781927c9e4057dfc31","md5":"8b1b5c46272a5f97a5e6f0b05f2f0f24","sha256":"55e3df72cabdf48bf576b4580d7fa2feba9c14aacde0a8bd7b1ef40b03cb7969"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"python-tlsh-4.5.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"8b1b5c46272a5f97a5e6f0b05f2f0f24","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.6","size":40216,"upload_time":"2021-06-15T20:02:37","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-06-15T20:02:37.882742Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/a0/05/921e95890f52cbcd2ebb5281ab0ed4f9b6039ba68d781927c9e4057dfc31/python-tlsh-4.5.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
