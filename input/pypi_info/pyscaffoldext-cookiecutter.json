if you haven't installed pyscaffold yet\n    pipx inject pyscaffold pyscaffoldext-cookiecutter\n\nNote that, after the installation, ``putup -h`` will show a new option\n``--cookiecutter TEMPLATE``.\nUse this option to point out which template you want to use (path or url).\nThe file structure created by `Cookiecutter`_ will be refined by PyScaffold\nafterwards.\nFor example:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    putup my-proj1 --cookiecutter ~/my-templates/default\n    putup my-proj2 --cookiecutter gh:something/from-github\n\nPlease refer to `Cookiecutter`_ documentation for more details on possible URLs\nand abbreviations.\n\nAn additional option ``--cookiecutter-params`` is also added, so you can have\nmore control over the values `Cookiecutter`_ uses when rendering the templates\n(PyScaffold will not run Cookiecutter's interactive prompt).\nThis option takes the form of a space separated list of ``NAME=VALUE``\narguments as showed in the example bellow:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    putup mypkg \\\n      --cookiecutter gh:pyscaffold/cookiecutter-pypackage \\\n      --cookiecutter-params command_line_interface=Argparse use_pytest=y\n\nCheck the ``cookiecutter.json`` file in the repository (or directory) of the template you are\nusing to see the available parameters.\nPlease notice PyScaffold already add some default parameters, as indicated in\nthe section **Suitable Templates** bellow.\n\n\nCookiecutter templates with PyScaffold\n======================================\n\nThe following example shows how to create a new package named ``mypkg``,\nthat uses a Cookiecutter template, but is enhanced by PyScaffold's features:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    putup mypkg --cookiecutter gh:pyscaffold/cookiecutter-pypackage\n\nThis is roughly equivalent to first create a project using the Cookiecutter\ntemplate and convert it to PyScaffold afterwards:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    cookiecutter --no-input gh:pyscaffold/cookiecutter-pypackage project_name=mypkg\n    putup mypkg --force\n\n.. note::\n   For complex Cookiecutter templates calling ``cookiecutter`` and ``putup``\n   separately may be a better option, since it is possible to answer\n   specific template questions or at least set values for Cookiecutter\n   variables.\n\n.. warning::\n   Although using Cookiecutter templates is a viable solution to customize\n   a project that was set up with PyScaffold, the recommended way is to help\n   improve PyScaffold by contributing an `extension`_.\n\n\n.. _suitable-templates:\n\nSuitable templates\n------------------\n\nNote that PyScaffold will overwrite some files generated by Cookiecutter,\nlike ``setup.py``, the ``__init__.py`` file under the package folder\nand most of the ``docs`` folder, in order to provide `setuptools_scm`_\nand `sphinx`_ integration.\nTherefore not all Cookiecutter templates are suitable for this approach.\n\nIdeally, interoperable templates should focus on the file structure inside the\n``src`` folder instead of packaging or distributing, since PyScaffold already\nhandles it under-the-hood. This also means that your template should adhere to\nthe src-layout if you want to generate files within your Python package.\n\nIn addition, PyScaffold runs Cookiecutter with the ``--no-input`` flag\nactivated and thus the user is not prompted for manual configuration. Instead,\nPyScaffold injects the following parameters::\n\n    author\n    email\n    full_name => same as author\n    project_name => the name of the folder where the project will be generated\n    repo_name => same as project_name\n    package_name => putup's --package (as in `import`)\n    namespace => putup's --namespace (if any)\n    installable_name => putup's --name (an installable name, like in PyPI/pip install)\n    project_short_description => putup's description\n    release_date => equivalent to the day you are running putup\n    year => equivalent to the year you are running putup\n\nAny extra parameter should be passed using the ``--cookiecutter-params`` option.\n\nAccordingly, the template file structure should be similar to::\n\n    cookiecutter-something/\n    └── {{cookiecutter.project_name}}/\n        └── src/\n            └── {{cookiecutter.package_name}}/\n                └── ...\n\nSee `Cookiecutter`_ for more information about template creation.\n\n.. note::\n   PyScaffold uses Cookiecutter only for its ability to create files.\n   Pre/post hooks that perform any other kind of side effect are not\n   guaranteed to work.\n\n\n.. _pyscaffold-notes:\n\nMaking Changes & Contributing\n=============================\n\nThis project uses `pre-commit`_, please make sure to install it before making any\nchanges::\n\n    pip install pre-commit\n    cd pyscaffoldext-cookiecutter\n    pre-commit install\n\nIt is a good idea to update the hooks to the latest version::\n\n    pre-commit autoupdate\n\nPlease also check PyScaffold's `contribution guidelines`_,\n\nNote\n====\n\nThis project has been set up using PyScaffold 4.0a2.
