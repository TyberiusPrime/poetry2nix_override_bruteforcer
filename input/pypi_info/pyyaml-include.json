With it, we can even include files by HTTP, SFTP, S3 ...\n\n> ⚠️ **Warning** \\\n> “pyyaml-include” `2.0` is **NOT compatible** with `1.0`\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\npip install \"pyyaml-include\"\n```\n\nSince we are using [fsspec][] to open including files from v2.0, an installation can be performed like below, if want to open remote files:\n\n- for files on website:\n\n  ```bash\n  pip install \"pyyaml-include\" fsspec[http]\n  ```\n\n- for files on S3:\n\n  ```bash\n  pip install \"pyyaml-include\" fsspec[s3]\n  ```\n\n- see [fsspec][]'s documentation for more\n\n> 🔖 **Tip** \\\n> “pyyaml-include” depends on [fsspec][], it will be installed no matter including local or remote files.\n\n## Basic usages\n\nConsider we have such [YAML][] files:\n\n```\n├── 0.yml\n└── include.d\n    ├── 1.yml\n    └── 2.yml\n```\n\n- `1.yml` 's content:\n\n  ```yaml\n  name: \"1\"\n  ```\n\n- `2.yml` 's content:\n\n  ```yaml\n  name: \"2\"\n  ```\n\nTo include `1.yml`, `2.yml` in `0.yml`, we shall:\n\n1. Register a `yaml_include.Constructor` to [PyYAML][]'s loader class, with `!inc` as it's tag:\n\n   ```python\n   import yaml\n   import yaml_include\n\n   # add the tag\n   yaml.add_constructor(\"!inc\", yaml_include.Constructor(base_dir='/your/conf/dir'))\n   ```\n\n1. Write `!inc` tags in `0.yaml`:\n\n   ```yaml\n   file1: !inc include.d/1.yml\n   file2: !inc include.d/1.yml\n   ```\n\n1. Load it\n\n   ```python\n   with open('0.yml') as f:\n      data = yaml.full_load(f)\n   print(data)\n   ```\n\n   we'll get:\n\n   ```python\n   {'file1':{'name':'1'},'file2':{'name':'2'}}\n   ```\n\n1. (optional) the constructor can be unregistered:\n\n   ```python\n   del yaml.Loader.yaml_constructors[\"!inc\"]\n   del yaml.UnSafeLoader.yaml_constructors[\"!inc\"]\n   del yaml.FullLoader.yaml_constructors[\"!inc\"]\n   ```\n\n### Include in Mapping\n\nIf `0.yml` was:\n\n```yaml\nfile1: !inc include.d/1.yml\nfile2: !inc include.d/2.yml\n```\n\nWe'll get:\n\n```yaml\nfile1:\n  name: \"1\"\nfile2:\n  name: \"2\"\n```\n\n### Include in Sequence\n\nIf `0.yml` was:\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  - !inc include.d/1.yml\n  - !inc include.d/2.yml\n```\n\nWe'll get:\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  - name: \"1\"\n  - name: \"2\"\n```\n\n## Advanced usages\n\n### Wildcards\n\nFile name can contain shell-style wildcards. Data loaded from the file(s) found by wildcards will be set in a sequence.\n\nThat is, a list will be returned when including file name contains wildcards.\nLength of the returned list equals number of matched files:\n\nIf `0.yml` was:\n\n```yaml\nfiles: !inc include.d/*.yml\n```\n\nWe'll get:\n\n```yaml\nfiles:\n  - name: \"1\"\n  - name: \"2\"\n```\n\n- when only 1 file matched, length of list will be 1\n- when there are no files matched, an empty list will be returned\n\nWe support `**`, `?` and `[..]`. We do not support `^` for pattern negation.\nThe `maxdepth` option is applied on the first `**` found in the path.\n\n> ❗ **Important**\n>\n> - Using the `**` pattern in large directory trees or remote file system (S3, HTTP ...) may consume an inordinate amount of time.\n> - There is no method like lazy-load or iteration, all data of found files returned to the YAML doc-tree are fully loaded in memory, large amount of memory may be needed if there were many or big files.\n\n### Work with fsspec\n\nIn `v2.0`, we use [fsspec][] to open including files, thus we can include files from many different sources, such as local file system, S3, HTTP, SFTP ...\n\nFor example, we can include a file from website in YAML:\n\n```yaml\nconf:\n  logging: !inc http://domain/etc/app/conf.d/logging.yml\n```\n\nIn such situations, when creating a `Constructor` constructor, a [fsspec][] filesystem object shall be set to `fs` argument.\n\nFor example, if want to include files from website, we shall:\n\n1. create a `Constructor` with a [fsspec][] HTTP filesystem object as it's `fs`:\n\n   ```python\n   import yaml\n   import fsspec\n   import yaml_include\n\n   http_fs = fsspec.filesystem(\"http\", client_kwargs={\"base_url\": f\"http://{HOST}:{PORT}\"})\n\n   ctor = yaml_include.Constructor(fs=http_fs, base_dir=\"/foo/baz\")\n   yaml.add_constructor(\"!inc\", ctor, yaml.Loader)\n   ```\n\n1. then, write a [YAML][] document to include files from `http://${HOST}:${PORT}`:\n\n   ```yaml\n   key1: !inc doc1.yml    # relative path to \"base_dir\"\n   key2: !inc ./doc2.yml  # relative path to \"base_dir\" also\n   key3: !inc /doc3.yml   # absolute path, \"base_dir\" does not affect\n   key3: !inc ../doc4.yml # relative path one level upper to \"base_dir\"\n   ```\n\n1. load it with [PyYAML][]:\n\n   ```python\n   yaml.load(yaml_string, yaml.Loader)\n   ```\n\nAbove [YAML][] snippet will be loaded like:\n\n- `key1`: pared YAML of `http://${HOST}:${PORT}/foo/baz/doc1.yml`\n- `key2`: pared YAML of `http://${HOST}:${PORT}/foo/baz/doc2.yml`\n- `key3`: pared YAML of `http://${HOST}:${PORT}/doc3.yml`\n- `key4`: pared YAML of `http://${HOST}:${PORT}/foo/doc4.yml`\n\n> 🔖 **Tip** \\\n> Check [fsspec][]'s documentation for more\n\n---\n\n> ℹ️ **Note** \\\n> If `fs` argument is omitted, a `\"file\"`/`\"local\"` [fsspec][] filesystem object will be used automatically. That is to say:\n>\n> ```yaml\n> data: !inc: foo/baz.yaml\n> ```\n>\n> is equivalent to (if no `base_dir` was set in `Constructor()`):\n>\n> ```yaml\n> data: !inc: file://foo/baz.yaml\n> ```\n>\n> and\n>\n> ```python\n> yaml.add_constructor(\"!inc\", Constructor())\n> ```\n>\n> is equivalent to:\n>\n> ```python\n> yaml.add_constructor(\"!inc\", Constructor(fs=fsspec.filesystem(\"file\")))\n> ```\n\n### Parameters in YAML\n\nAs a callable object, `Constructor` passes YAML tag parameters to [fsspec][] for more detailed operations.\n\nThe first argument is `urlpath`, it's fixed and must-required, either positional or named.\nNormally, we put it as a string after the tag(eg: `!inc`), just like examples above.\n\nHowever, there are more parameters.\n\n- in a sequence way, parameters will be passed to python as positional arguments, like `*args` in python function. eg:\n\n  ```yaml\n  files: !inc [include.d/**/*.yaml, {maxdepth: 1}, {encoding: utf16}]\n  ```\n\n- in a mapping way, parameters will be passed to python as named arguments, like `**kwargs` in python function. eg:\n\n  ```yaml\n  files: !inc {urlpath: /foo/baz.yaml, encoding: utf16}\n  ```\n\nBut the format of parameters has multiple cases, and differs variably in different [fsspec][] implementation backends.\n\n- If a scheme/protocol(“`http://`”, “`sftp://`”, “`file://`”, etc.) is defined, and there is no wildcard in `urlpath`, `Constructor` will invoke [`fsspec.open`](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#fsspec.open) directly to open it. Which means `Constructor`'s `fs` will be ignored, and a new standalone `fs` will be created implicitly.\n\n  In this situation, `urlpath` will be passed to `fsspec.open`'s first argument, and all other parameters will also be passed to the function.\n\n  For example,\n\n  - the [YAML][] snippet\n\n    ```yaml\n    files: !inc [file:///foo/baz.yaml, r]\n    ```\n\n    will cause python code like\n\n    ```python\n    with fsspec.open(\"file:///foo/baz.yaml\", \"r\") as f:\n        yaml.load(f, Loader)\n    ```\n\n  - and the [YAML][] snippet\n\n    ```yaml\n    files: !inc {urlpath: file:///foo/baz.yaml, encoding: utf16}\n    ```\n\n    will cause python code like\n\n    ```python\n    with fsspec.open(\"file:///foo/baz.yaml\", encoding=\"utf16\") as f:\n        yaml.load(f, Loader)\n    ```\n\n- If `urlpath` has wildcard, and also scheme in it, `Constructor` will:\n\n  Invoke [fsspec][]'s [`open_files`](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#fsspec.open_files) function to search, open and load files, and return the results in a list. [YAML][] include statement's parameters are passed to `open_files` function.\n\n- If `urlpath` has wildcard, and no scheme in it, `Constructor` will:\n\n  1. invoke corresponding [fsspec][] implementation backend's [`glob`](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#fsspec.spec.AbstractFileSystem.glob) method to search files,\n  1. then call [`open`](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#fsspec.spec.AbstractFileSystem.open) method to open each found file(s).\n\n  `urlpath` will be passed as the first argument to both `glob` and `open` method of the corresponding [fsspec][] implementation backend, and other parameters will also be passed to `glob` and `open` method as their following arguments.\n\n  In the case of wildcards, what need to pay special attention to is that there are **two separated parameters** after `urlpath`, the first is for `glob` method, and the second is for `open` method. Each of them could be either sequence, mapping or scalar, corresponds single, positional and named argument(s) in python. For example:\n\n  - If we want to include every `.yml` file in directory `etc/app` recursively with max depth at 2, and open them in utf-16 codec, we shall write the [YAML][] as below:\n\n    ```yaml\n    files: !inc [\"etc/app/**/*.yml\", {maxdepth: !!int \"2\"}, {encoding: utf16}]\n    ```\n\n    it will cause python code like:\n\n    ```python\n    for file in local_fs.glob(\"etc/app/**/*.yml\", maxdepth=2):\n        with local_fs.open(file, encoding=\"utf16\") as f:\n            yaml.load(f, Loader)\n    ```\n\n  - Since `maxdepth` is the seconde argument after `path` in `glob` method, we can also write the [YAML][] like this:\n\n    ```yaml\n    files: !inc [\"etc/app/**/*.yml\", [!!int \"2\"]]\n    ```\n\n    The parameters for `open` is omitted, means no more arguments except `urlpath` is passed.\n\n    it will cause python code like:\n\n    ```python\n    for file in local_fs.glob(\"etc/app/**/*.yml\", 2):\n        with local_fs.open(file) as f:\n            yaml.load(f, Loader)\n    ```\n\n  - The two parameters can be in a mapping form, and name of the keys are `\"glob\"` and `\"open\"`. for example:\n\n    ```yaml\n    files: !inc {urlpath: \"etc/app/**/*.yml\", glob: [!!int \"2\"], open: {encoding: utf16}}\n    ```\n\n  > ❗ **Important** \\\n  > [PyYAML][] sometimes takes scalar parameter of custom constructor as string, we can use a ‘Standard YAML tag’ to ensure non-string data type in the situation.\n  >\n  > For example, following [YAML][] snippet may cause an error:\n  >\n  > ```yaml\n  > files: !inc [\"etc/app/**/*.yml\", open: {intParam: 1}]\n  > ```\n  >\n  > Because [PyYAML][] treats `{\"intParam\": 1}` as `{\"intParam\": \"1\"}`, which makes python code like `fs.open(path, intParam=\"1\")`. To prevent this, we shall write the [YAML][] like:\n  >\n  > ```yaml\n  > files: !inc [\"etc/app/**/*.yml\", open: {intParam: !!int 1}]\n  > ```\n  >\n  > where `!!int` is a ‘Standard YAML tag’ to force integer type of `maxdepth` argument.\n  >\n  > > ℹ️ **Note** \\\n  > > `BaseLoader`, `SafeLoader`, `CBaseLoader`, `CSafeLoader` do **NOT** support ‘Standard YAML tag’.\n  > ---\n  > > 🔖 **Tip** \\\n  > > `maxdepth` argument of [fsspec][] `glob` method is already force converted by `Constructor`, no need to write a `!!int` tag on it.\n\n- Else, `Constructor` will invoke corresponding [fsspec][] implementation backend's [`open`](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api.html#fsspec.spec.AbstractFileSystem.open) method to open the file, parameters beside `urlpath` will be passed to the method.\n\n### Absolute and Relative URL/Path\n\nWhen the path after include tag (eg: `!inc`) is not a full protocol/scheme URL and not starts with `\"/\"`, `Constructor` tries to join the path with `base_dir`, which is a argument of `Constructor.__init__()`.\nIf `base_dir` is omitted or `None`, the actually including file path is the path in defined in [YAML][] without a change, and different [fsspec][] filesystem will treat them differently. In local filesystem, it will be `cwd`.\n\nFor remote filesystem, `HTTP` for example, the `base_dir` can not be `None` and usually be set to `\"/\"`.\n\nRelative path does not support full protocol/scheme URL format, `base_dir` does not effect for that.\n\nFor example, if we register such a `Constructor` to [PyYAML][]:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\nimport fsspec\nimport yaml_include\n\nyaml.add_constructor(\n    \"!http-include\",\n    yaml_include.Constructor(\n        fsspec.filesystem(\"http\", client_kwargs={\"base_url\": f\"http://{HOST}:{PORT}\"}),\n        base_dir=\"/sub_1/sub_1_1\"\n    )\n)\n```\n\nthen, load following [YAML][]:\n\n```yaml\nxyz: !http-include xyz.yml\n```\n\nthe actual URL to access is `http://$HOST:$PORT/sub_1/sub_1_1/xyz.yml`\n\n### Serialization\n\nWhen load [YAML][] string with include statement, the including files are default parsed into python objects. Thant is, if we call `yaml.dump()` on the object, what dumped is the parsed python object, and can not serialize the include statement itself.\n\nTo serialize the statement, we shall first create an `yaml_include.Constructor` object whose **`autoload` is `False`**:\n\n```python\nimport yaml\nimport yaml_include\n\nctor = yaml_include.Constructor(autoload=False)\n```\n\nthen add both Constructor for Loader and Representer for Dumper:\n\n```python\nyaml.add_constructor(\"!inc\", ctor)\n\nrpr = yaml_include.Representer(\"inc\")\nyaml.add_representer(yaml_include.Data, rpr)\n```\n\nNow, the including files will not be loaded when call `yaml.load()`, and `yaml_include.Data` objects will be placed at the positions where include statements are.\n\ncontinue above code:\n\n```python\nyaml_str = \"\"\"\n- !inc include.d/1.yaml\n- !inc include.d/2.yaml\n\"\"\"\n\nd0 = yaml.load(yaml_str, yaml.Loader)\n# Here, \"include.d/1.yaml\" and \"include.d/2.yaml\" not be opened or loaded.\n# d0 is like:\n# [Data(urlpath=\"include.d/1.yaml\"), Data(urlpath=\"include.d/2.yaml\")]\n\n# serialize d0\ns = yaml.dump(d0)\nprint(s)\n# ‘s’ will be:\n# - !inc 'include.d/1.yaml'\n# - !inc 'include.d/2.yaml'\n\n# de-serialization\nctor.autoload = True # re-open auto load\n# then load, the file \"include.d/1.yaml\" and \"include.d/2.yaml\" will be opened and loaded.\nd1 = yaml.load(s, yaml.Loader)\n\n# Or perform a recursive opening / parsing on the object:\nd2 = yaml_include.load(d0) # d2 is equal to d1\n```\n\n`autoload` can be used in a `with` statement:\n\n```python\nctor = yaml_include.Constructor()\n# autoload is True here\n\nwith ctor.managed_autoload(False):\n    # temporary set autoload to False\n    yaml.full_load(YAML_TEXT)\n# autoload restore True automatic\n```\n\n### Include JSON or TOML\n\nWe can include files in different format other than [YAML][], like [JSON][] or [TOML][] -- ``custom_loader`` is for that.\n\n> 📑 **Example** \\\n> For example:\n>\n> ```python\n> import json\n> import tomllib as toml\n> import yaml\n> import yaml_include\n>\n> # Define loader function\n> def my_loader(urlpath, file, Loader):\n>     if urlpath.endswith(\".json\"):\n>         return json.load(file)\n>     if urlpath.endswith(\".toml\"):\n>         return toml.load(file)\n>     return yaml.load(file, Loader)\n>\n> # Create the include constructor, with the custom loader\n> ctor = yaml_include.Constructor(custom_loader=my_loader)\n>\n> # Add the constructor to YAML Loader\n> yaml.add_constructor(\"!inc\", ctor, yaml.Loader)\n>\n> # Then, json files will can be loaded by std-lib's json module, and the same to toml files.\n> s = \"\"\"\n> json: !inc \"*.json\"\n> toml: !inc \"*.toml\"\n> yaml: !inc \"*.yaml\"\n> \"\"\"\n>\n> yaml.load(s, yaml.Loader)\n> ```\n\n## Develop\n\n1. clone the repo:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/tanbro/pyyaml-include.git\n   cd pyyaml-include\n   ```\n\n1. create then activate a python virtual-env:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv .venv\n   .venv/bin/activate\n   ```\n\n1. install development requirements and the project itself in editable mode:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\nNow you can work on it.\n\n## Test\n\nread: `tests/README.md`\n\n[YAML]: http://yaml.org/ \"YAML: YAML Ain't Markup Language™\"\n[PyYaml]: https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/ \"PyYAML is a full-featured YAML framework for the Python programming language.\"\n[fsspec]: https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec/ \"Filesystem Spec (fsspec) is a project to provide a unified pythonic interface to local, remote and embedded file systems and bytes storage.\"\n[JSON]: https://json.io/ \"JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format.
