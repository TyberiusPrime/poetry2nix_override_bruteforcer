This is a fork of OpenAI's [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) library by it's maintainers (OpenAI handed over maintenance a few years ago to an outside team), and is where future maintenance will occur going forward.\n\nThe documentation website is at [gymnasium.farama.org](https://gymnasium.farama.org), and we have a public discord server (which we also use to coordinate development work) that you can join here: https://discord.gg/bnJ6kubTg6\n\n## Environments\n\nGymnasium includes the following families of environments along with a wide variety of third-party environments\n* [Classic Control](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/) - These are classic reinforcement learning based on real-world problems and physics.\n* [Box2D](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/) - These environments all involve toy games based around physics control, using box2d based physics and PyGame-based rendering\n* [Toy Text](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/toy_text/) - These environments are designed to be extremely simple, with small discrete state and action spaces, and hence easy to learn. As a result, they are suitable for debugging implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms.\n* [MuJoCo](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/mujoco/) - A physics engine based environments with multi-joint control which are more complex than the Box2D environments.\n* [Atari](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/atari/) - A set of 57 Atari 2600 environments simulated through Stella and the Arcade Learning Environment that have a high range of complexity for agents to learn.\n* [Third-party](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/third_party_environments/) - A number of environments have been created that are compatible with the Gymnasium API. Be aware of the version that the software was created for and use the `apply_env_compatibility` in `gymnasium.make` if necessary.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the base Gymnasium library, use `pip install gymnasium`\n\nThis does not include dependencies for all families of environments (there's a massive number, and some can be problematic to install on certain systems). You can install these dependencies for one family like `pip install \"gymnasium[atari]\"` or use `pip install \"gymnasium[all]\"` to install all dependencies.\n\nWe support and test for Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11 on Linux and macOS. We will accept PRs related to Windows, but do not officially support it.\n\n## API\n\nThe Gymnasium API models environments as simple Python `env` classes. Creating environment instances and interacting with them is very simple- here's an example using the \"CartPole-v1\" environment:\n\n```python\nimport gymnasium as gym\nenv = gym.make(\"CartPole-v1\")\n\nobservation, info = env.reset(seed=42)\nfor _ in range(1000):\n    action = env.action_space.sample()\n    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)\n\n    if terminated or truncated:\n        observation, info = env.reset()\nenv.close()\n```\n\n## Notable Related Libraries\n\nPlease note that this is an incomplete list, and just includes libraries that the maintainers most commonly point newcommers to when asked for recommendations.\n\n* [CleanRL](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl) is a learning library based on the Gymnasium API. It is designed to cater to newer people in the field and provides very good reference implementations.\n* [PettingZoo](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/PettingZoo) is a multi-agent version of Gymnasium with a number of implemented environments, i.e. multi-agent Atari environments.\n* The Farama Foundation also has a collection of many other [environments](https://farama.org/projects) that are maintained by the same team as Gymnasium and use the Gymnasium API.\n* [Comet](https://www.comet.com/site/?utm_source=gymnasium&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=partner_gymnasium_2023&utm_content=github) is a free ML-Ops tool that tracks rewards, metrics, hyperparameters, and code for ML training runs. Comet has an easy-to use integration with Gymnasium, here's a [tutorial](https://bit.ly/CometGymnasiumIntegration) on how to use them together! Comet is a sponsor of the Farama Foundation!\n\n\n\n## Environment Versioning\n\nGymnasium keeps strict versioning for reproducibility reasons. All environments end in a suffix like \"-v0\".  When changes are made to environments that might impact learning results, the number is increased by one to prevent potential confusion. These inherent from Gym.\n\n## Development Roadmap\n\nWe have a roadmap for future development work for Gymnasium available here: https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/issues/12\n\n## Support Gymnasium's Development\n\nIf you are financially able to do so and would like to support the development of Gymnasium, please join others in the community in [donating to us](https://github.com/sponsors/Farama-Foundation).\n\n## Citation\n\nYou can cite Gymnasium as:\n\n```\n@misc{towers_gymnasium_2023,\n        title = {Gymnasium},\n        url =
