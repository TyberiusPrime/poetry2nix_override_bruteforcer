This is default in most version\ncontrol system except Perforce, which needs an environment variable\n``P4DIFF=\"diff -u\"`` to output unified diff.\n\n.. _`Unified Format`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff#Unified_format\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nYdiff only depends on Python built-in libraries, so you can just download the\nsource and run without worrying about any installation.\n\nGit tagged `releases`_ will be packaged and uploaded to PyPI timely, however,\npackages hosted elsewhere are not (please note they are not managed by the\nauthor `@ymattw`_).\n\n.. _`@ymattw`: https://github.com/ymattw\n.. _`releases`: https://github.com/ymattw/ydiff/releases\n\nDownload directly\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJust save `ydiff.py`_ to whatever directory which is in your ``$PATH``, for\nexample, ``$HOME/bin`` is in my ``$PATH``, so I save the script there and name\nas ``ydiff``.\n\n.. _`ydiff.py`: https://raw.github.com/ymattw/ydiff/master/ydiff.py\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    curl -ksSL https://raw.github.com/ymattw/ydiff/master/ydiff.py > ~/bin/ydiff\n    chmod +x ~/bin/ydiff\n\nInstall with pip\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYdiff is already listed on `PyPI`_, you can install with ``pip`` if you have\nthe tool.\n\n.. _PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ydiff\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install --upgrade ydiff\n\nInstall with setup.py\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can also run the setup.py from the source if you don't have ``pip``.\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    git clone https://github.com/ymattw/ydiff.git\n    cd ydiff\n    ./setup.py install\n\nInstall with Homebrew\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou can also install with Homebrew on Mac.
