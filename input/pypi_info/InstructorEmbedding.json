Please refer to our [project page](https://instructor-embedding.github.io/) for a quick project overview.\n\nWe introduce **Instructor**üë®‚Äçüè´, an instruction-finetuned text embedding model that can generate text embeddings tailored to any task (e.g., classification, retrieval, clustering, text evaluation, etc.) and domains (e.g., science, finance, etc.) ***by simply providing the task instruction, without any finetuning***. Instructorüë®‚Äç achieves sota on 70 diverse embedding tasks!\n\n**************************** **Updates** ****************************\n\n* 01/21: We updated the code structure, which supports easy package installation.\n* 12/28: We updated the [checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/hkunlp/instructor-large) with hard negatives.\n* 12/20: We released [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09741), [code](https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding), [project page](https://instructor-embedding.github.io/) and [checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/hkunlp/instructor-large).

You can easily try it out in [Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1P7ivNLMosHyG7XOHmoh7CoqpXryKy3Qt?usp=sharing). In your local machine, we recommend to first create a virtual environment:\n```bash\nconda env create -n instructor python=3.7\ngit clone https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nThat will create the environment `instructor` we used. To use the embedding tool, first install the `InstructorEmbedding` package from PyPI\n```bash\npip install InstructorEmbedding\n```\nor directly install it from our code\n```bash\npip install -e .\n```\n\n### Environment setup\n\nActivate the environment by running\n```bash\nconda activate instructor\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\nFirst download a pretrained model (See [model list](#model-list) for a full list of available models)\n\n```python\nfrom InstructorEmbedding import INSTRUCTOR\nmodel = INSTRUCTOR('hkunlp/instructor-large')\n```\n\nThen provide the sentence and customized instruction to the model.\n```python\n# prepare texts with instructions\ntext_instruction_pairs = [\n    {\"instruction\": \"Represent the Science title:\", \"text\": \"3D ActionSLAM: wearable person tracking in multi-floor environments\"},\n    {\"instruction\": \"Represent the Medicine sentence for retrieving a duplicate sentence:\", \"text\": \"Recent studies have suggested that statins, an established drug group in the prevention of cardiovascular mortality, could delay or prevent breast cancer recurrence but the effect on disease-specific mortality remains unclear.\"}\n]\n\n# postprocess\ntexts_with_instructions = []\nfor pair in text_instruction_pairs:\n    texts_with_instructions.append([pair[\"instruction\"], pair[\"text\"]])\n\n# calculate embeddings\ncustomized_embeddings = model.encode(texts_with_instructions)\n```\n\nAnd that's it already. We now have a list of numpy arrays with the embeddings.\n\n```python\nfor pair, embedding in zip(text_instruction_pairs, customized_embeddings):\n    print(\"Instruction: \", pair[\"instruction\"])\n    print(\"text: \", pair[\"text\"])\n    print(\"Embedding: \", embedding)\n    print(\"\")\n```\n\n## Model List\n\nWe released a series of INSTRUCTOR checkpoints with different sizes. You can easily load these models with `InstructorEmbedding` package. \n|              Model              | Avg.

You may need to first download the [MEDI data](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vZ5c2oJNonGOvXzppNg5mHz24O6jcc52/view?usp=sharing), unzip the folder and put `medi-data.json` under `--cache_dir`.\n```python\npython train.py --model_name_or_path sentence-transformers/gtr-t5-large --output_dir {output_directory} --cache_dir {cache_directory} --max_source_length 512 --num_train_epochs 10 --save_steps 500 --cl_temperature 0.01 --warmup_ratio 0.1 --learning_rate 2e-5 --overwrite_output_dir\n```\nWe explain the arguments in the following:\n* `--model_name_or_path`: Pretrained checkpoints to start with. We support both model id (e.g., `sentence-transformers/gtr-t5-large`, `sentence-transformers/sentence-t5-large`) or checkpoint path (e.g., checkpoint saved by transformers trainer).\n* `--cl_temperature`: Temperature for contrastive loss\n* `--cache_dir`: The directory to cache downloaded models and data. The downloaded MEDI data(`medi-data.json`) should be put under the directory `--cache_dir`.\n* `--output_dir`: The directory to store the trained models(checkpoints) for evaluation. \n\nAll the other arguments are standard `Huggingface's transformers` training arguments, such as `--overwrite_output_dir`, `--num_train_epochs`, `--learning_rate`. For details, refer to [Huggingface transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) \n\n## Evaluation\nWe evaluate INSTRUCTOR massively on 70 diverse tasks, spanning a wide range of tasks and domains. Specifically, we build our evaluation on three benchmarks, [MTEB](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard), [Billboard](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04139), and [Prompt Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01975). We explain the details about running evaluation scripts in the following.\n<!-- * MTEB is a comprehensive embedding evaluation benchmark that aims to provide a holistic view of embedding models.  It combines several conventional benchmarks (e.g., BEIR and STS) and spans a wide range of domain-specific datasets, including science, biology, and medicine. \n* Prompt Retrieval tasks aim to retrieve a few in-context learning (i.e., demonstration) examples from annotated examples given a test instance. The embedding model is used to encode all annotated examples and to find the few most similar examples to the test instance based on the cosine similarity. We evaluate embeddings by measuring the average performance on the downstream tasks. \n* Billboard applies INSTRUCTOR to automatic evaluations for text generation tasks. Following [Kasai et al. (2022a)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04139), we measure the cosine similarity between the generated text and each reference text and take the maximum similarity score over all references available. We evaluate all embedding models by the Pearson correlation with the human judgments. -->\n\n### MTEB\nTo evaluate the model performance on MTEB benchmark dataset, first install the MTEB library\n\n```python\ncd evaluation/MTEB\npip install -e .\n```\nThen run the following command:\n```python\npython examples/evaluate_model.py --model_name hkunlp/instructor-large --output_dir outputs --task_name ArguAna --result_file results\n```\nYou can evaluate your trained model checkpoints by specifying `--model_name` and run all MTEB datasets by changing `--task_name`. Check [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09741) or [MTEB benchmark](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) for evaluation metrics of all tasks.\n\n### Billboard\nTo evaluate the model performance on Billboard, run the following command:\n```python\ncd evaluation/text_evaluation\npython main.py --model_name hkunlp/instructor-large --task mscoco --add_prompt\n```\nYou can evaluate your trained model checkpoints by specifying `--model_name` and run all Billboard datasets by changing `--task`. In all of the three datasets in Billboard, we report the Pearson correlation.\n\n### Prompt Retrieval\nTo evaluate the model performance on Prompt Retrieval, run the following command:\n```python\ncd evaluation/prompt_retrieval\npython main.py --embedding_model hkunlp/instructor-large --task rte --model_cache_dir {cache_dir} --output_dir {output_dir} --add_prompt\n```\nYou can evaluate your trained model checkpoints by specifying `--model_name` and run prompt retrieval datasets by changing `--task`. In order to have a consistent metric, we cast all tasks in Prompt Retrieval into a \"text-to-text\" format, and report the Rouge-L score.\n\n## Bugs or questions?\nIf you have any question related to the code or the paper, feel free to email Hongjin (`hjsu@cs.hku.hk`) and Weijia (`swj0419@cs.washington.edu`).
