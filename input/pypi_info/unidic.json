{"info":{"author":"Paul O'Leary McCann","author_email":"polm@dampfkraft.com","bugtrack_url":null,"classifiers":["License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License","Natural Language :: Japanese"],"description":"# unidic-py\n\nThis is a version of [UniDic](https://unidic.ninjal.ac.jp/) packaged for use\nwith pip. \n\nCurrently it supports 2.3.0, the latest version of UniDic. **Note this will\ntake up 1GB on disk after install.** If you want a small package, try\n[unidic-lite](https://github.com/polm/unidic-lite).\n\nThe data for this dictionary is hosted as part of the AWS Open Data\nSponsorship Program. You can read the announcement\n[here](https://aws.amazon.com/jp/blogs/news/published-unidic-mecab-on-aws-open-data/).\n\nAfter installing via pip, you need to download the dictionary using the\nfollowing command:\n\n    python -m unidic download\n\nWith [fugashi](https://github.com/polm/fugashi) or\n[mecab-python3](https://github.com/samurait/mecab-python3) unidic will be used\nautomatically when installed, though if you want you can manually pass the\nMeCab arguments:\n\n    import fugashi\n    import unidic\n    tagger = fugashi.Tagger('-d \"{}\"'.format(unidic.DICDIR))\n    # that's it!\n\n## Differences from the Official UniDic Release\n\nThis has a few changes from the official UniDic release to make it easier to use.\n\n- entries for 令和 have been added\n- single-character numeric and alphabetic words have been deleted\n- `unk.def` has been modified so unknown punctuation won't be marked as a noun\n\nSee the `extras` directory for details on how to replicate the build process.\n\n## Fields\n\nHere is a list of fields included in this edition of UniDic. For more information see the [UniDic FAQ](https://unidic.ninjal.ac.jp/faq#col_name), though not all fields are included. For fields in the UniDic FAQ the name given there is included.\n\nFields which are not applicable are usually marked with an asterisk (`*`).\n\n- **pos1, pos2, pos3, pos4**: Part of speech fields. The earlier fields are more general, the later fields are more specific.\n- **cType:** 活用型, conjugation type. Will have a value like `五段-ラ行`. \n- **cForm:** 活用形, conjugation shape. Will have a value like `連用形-促音便`.\n- **lForm:** 語彙素読み, lemma reading. The reading of the lemma in katakana, this uses the same format as the `kana` field, not `pron`.\n- **lemma:** 語彙素（＋語彙素細分類）. The lemma is a non-inflected \"dictionary form\" of a word. UniDic lemmas sometimes include extra info or have unusual forms, like using katakana for some place names. \n- **orth:** 書字形出現形, the word as it appears in text, this appears to be identical to the surface.\n- **pron:** 発音形出現形, pronunciation. This is similar to kana except that long vowels are indicated with a ー, so 講師 is こーし. \n- **orthBase:** 書字形基本形, the uninflected form of the word using its current written form. For example, for 彷徨った the lemma is さ迷う but the orthBase is 彷徨う. \n- **pronBase:** 発音形基本形, the pronunciation of the base form. Like `pron` for the `lemma` or `orthBase`.\n- **goshu:** 語種, word type. Etymological category. In order of frequency, 和, 固, 漢, 外, 混, 記号, 不明. Defined for all dictionary words, blank for unks.\n- **iType:** 語頭変化化型, \"i\" is for \"initial\". This is the type of initial transformation the word undergoes when combining, for example 兵 is へ半濁 because it can be read as べい in combination. This is available for <2% of entries.\n- **iForm:** 語頭変化形, this is the initial form of the word in context, such as 基本形 or 半濁音形. \n- **fType:** 語末変化化型, \"f\" is for \"final\", but otherwise as iType. For example 医学 is ク促 because it can change to いがっ (apparently). This is available for <0.1% of entries.\n- **fForm:** 語末変化形, as iForm but for final transformations.\n- **iConType:** 語頭変化結合型, initial change fusion type. Describes phonetic change at the start of the word in counting expressions. Only available for a few hundred entries, mostly numbers. Values are N followed by a letter or number; most entries with this value are numeric.\n- **fConType:** 語末変化結合型, final change fusion type. This is also used for counting expressions, and like iConType it is only available for a few hundred entries. Unlike iConType the values are very complicated, like `B1S6SjShS,B1S6S8SjShS`. \n- **type:** Not entirely clear what this is, seems to have some overlap with POS. \n- **kana:** 読みがな, this is the typical representation of a word in kana, unlike pron. 講師 is こうし.\n- **kanaBase:** 仮名形基本形, this is the typical kana representation of the lemma.\n- **form:** 語形出現形, seems to be the same as `pron`.\n- **formBase:** 語形基本形 seems to be the same as `pronBase`.\n- **aType:** Accent type. This is a (potentially) comma-separated field which has the number of the mora taking the accent in 標準語 (standard language). When there are multiple values, more common accent patterns come first.\n- **aConType:** This describes how the accent shifts when the word is used in a counter expression. It uses complicated notation.\n- **aModType:** Presumably accent related but unclear use. Available for <25% of entries and only has 6 non-default values.\n- **lid:** 語彙表ID. A long lemma ID. This seems to be a kind of GUID. There is usually one entry per line in the CSV, except that half-width and full-width variations can be combined.\n- **lemma_id:** 語彙素ID. A shorter lemma id, starting from 1. This seems to be as unique as the `lemma` field, so many CSV lines can share this value.\n\n# License\n\nThe modern Japanese UniDic is available under the GPL, LGPL, or BSD license,\n[see here](https://unidic.ninjal.ac.jp/download#unidic_bccwj).
