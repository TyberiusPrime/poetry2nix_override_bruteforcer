This package\ndoes not itself solve this 100% (because the nuance _still_ isn't readily encodable),\nbut the goal is to not make things worse. That is, running Firefox on a system\nconfigured to use a buildcatrust-built certificate store should not drop\ndistrust dates. Other software may vary, depending on support for\ndistrust-after.\n\n## Goals\n\n* Have no runtime dependencies outside of the Python standard library\n  - This is because this complicates packaging, particularly on NixOS, where\n    buildcatrust is part of the bootstrap path for building everything else.\n* Have decent test coverage\n* Convey as many trust bits from the source system to downstream systems as\n  possible\n  - In some cases, this means using software-specific hacks (such as for\n    OpenSSL)\n\n## Contributing & Developing\n\nUsers are expected to abide by [the Contributor Covenant, version\n2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/).\n\nThe best answer for developing this software is to use Nix, which will provide\ndependencies for you automatically (at least on Linux-based distributions).\n\nYou should be able to run `nix-shell` in the root of this repo to get a working\nshell containing a Python interpreter with `ruff`, `pytest`, `pytype`, and so\non.\n\nIt is also suggested to run `pre-commit` when making changes; you can install\nits hook using `pre-commit install` which will ensure that things are correctly\nformatted before permitting a commit.\n\nHowever, because this software aims to have no dependencies outside of the\nPython stdlib, it should be possible to at least make changes and run the\nsoftware without needing Nix or any other software installed. I do suggest that\nyou install `pytest` and `ruff` though, because then you can ensure a baseline\nlevel of correctness before letting GitHub Actions judge your PR.\n\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"","keywords":"","license":"","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"Luke
