A very\nsmall number of functions do the heavy lifting. These come from two modules:\n`time` and `calendar`.\n\n`time` is a thin wrapper around the C time functions. I'm working on the\nassumption that these are usually of high quality and are correct. From the\n`time` module, `strict_rfc3339` uses:\n\n - `time`: (actually calls `gettimeofday`) to get the current timestamp / \"now\"\n - `gmtime`: splits a timestamp into a UTC time tuple\n - `localtime`: splits a timestamp into a local time tuple\n\nBased on the assumption that they are correct, we can use the difference\nbetween the values returned by `gmtime` and `localtime` to find the local\noffset.  As clunky as it sounds, it's far easier than using a fully fledged\ntimezone library.\n\n`calendar` is implemented in python. From `calendar`, `strict_rfc3339` uses:\n\n - `timegm`: turns a UTC time tuple into a timestamp. This essentially just\n   multiplies each number in the tuple by the number of seconds in it. It does\n   use `datetime.date` to work out the number of days between Jan 1 1970 and the\n   Y-M-D in the tuple, but this is fine. It does not perform much validation at\n   all.\n - `monthrange`: gives the number of days in a (year, month). I checked and\n   (at least in my copy of python 2.6) the function used for leap years is\n   identical to the one specified in RFC3339 itself.\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n - RFC3339 specifies an offset, not a timezone, and the difference is\n   important. Timezones are evil.\n - It is perhaps simpler to think of a RFC3339 string as a human readable\n   method of specifying a moment in time (only). These functions merely provide\n   access to the one-to-many timestamp-to-RFC3339 mapping.\n - Timestamps don't support leap seconds: a day is always 86400 \"long\".\n   Also, validating leap seconds is particularly fiddly, because not only do\n   you need some data, but it must be kept up to date.\n   For this reason, `strict_rfc3339` does not support leap seconds: in validation,\n   `seconds == 60` or `seconds == 61` is rejected.\n   In the case of reverse leap seconds, calendar.timegm will blissfully accept\n   it. The result would be about as correct as you could get.\n - RFC3339 generation using `gmtime` or `localtime` may be limited by the size\n   of `time_t` on the system: if it is 32 bit, you're limited to dates between\n   (approx) 1901 and 2038. This does not affect `rfc3339_to_timestamp`.","description_content_type":null,"docs_url":null,"download_url":"UNKNOWN","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"http://www.danielrichman.co.uk/libraries/strict-rfc3339.html","keywords":null,"license":"GNU
