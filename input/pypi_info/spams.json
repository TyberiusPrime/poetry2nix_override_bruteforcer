{"info":{"author":"Julien Mairal","author_email":"spams.dev@inria.fr","bugtrack_url":null,"classifiers":[],"description":"# SPAMS: a SPArse Modeling Software\n\nHere is the Python package interfacing the SPAMS C++ library.\n\n## What is SPAMS?\n\nSPAMS (SPArse Modeling Software) is an optimization toolbox for solving various sparse estimation problems.\n\n- Dictionary learning and matrix factorization (NMF, sparse PCA, ...)\n- Solving sparse decomposition problems with LARS, coordinate descent, OMP, SOMP, proximal methods\n- Solving structured sparse decomposition problems (l1/l2, l1/linf, sparse group lasso, tree-structured regularization, structured sparsity with overlapping groups, ...)\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Requirements\n\n- a C++ modern compiler (tested with gcc >= 4.5)\n- a BLAS/LAPACK library (like OpenBLAS, Intel MKL, Atlas)\n\nCarefully install **libblas & liblapack**. For example, on Ubuntu, it is necessary to do `sudo apt-get -y install libblas-dev liblapack-dev gfortran`. For MacOS, you most likely need to do `brew install gcc openblas lapack`.\n\nFor better performance, we recommend to install the **MKL Intel library** (available for instance on PyPI with `pip install mkl`, or in the Anaconda Python distribution with `conda install mkl`) before installing Numpy (which is a dependency of SPAMS, the latter checking Numpy configuration for its installation).\n\nSPAMS for Python was tested on **Linux** and **MacOS**. It is **not available for Windows** at the moment. **For MacOS users**, the install setup detects if OpenMP is available on your system and enable/disable OpenMP support accordingly. For better performance, we recommend to install an **OpenMP-compatible compiler** on your system (e.g. `gcc` or `llvm`).\n\n**Note for Windows users:** at the moment you can run `pip install spams-bin` (provided by <https://github.com/samuelstjean/spams-python>).\n\n### Installation from PyPI:\n\nThe standard installation uses the BLAS and LAPACK libraries used by Numpy:\n```bash\npip install spams\n```\n\n### Installation from sources\n\nMake sure you have install libblas & liblapack (see above)\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/getspams/spams-python\ncd spams-python\npip install -e .\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nManipulated objects are imported from numpy and scipy. Matrices should be stored by columns, and sparse matrices should be \"column compressed\".\n\n\n### Testing the interface\n\n- From the command line (to be called from the project root directory):\n```bash\npython tests/test_spams.py -h       # print the man page\npython tests/test_spams.py          # run all the tests\n```\n\n- From Python (assuming `spams` package is installed):\n```python\nfrom spams.tests import test_spams\n\ntest_spams('-h')                    # print the man page\ntest_spams()                        # run all tests\ntest_spams(['sort', 'calcAAt'])     # run specific tests\ntest_spams(python_exec='python3')   # specify the python exec\n```\n\n- From the command line (assuming `spams` package is installed):\n```bash\n# c.f. previous point for the different options\npython -c \"from spams.tests import test_spams; test_spams()\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Links\n\n- [Official website](https://thoth.inrialpes.fr/people/mairal/spams/) (documentation and downloads)\n- [Python specific project](https://github.com/getspams/spams-python) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/spams/) repository (available with `pip install spams`)\n- [R specific project](https://github.com/getspams/spams-R) (available with `remotes::install_github(\"getspams/spams-R\")`)\n- [Original C++ project](https://github.com/getspams/spams-devel) (and original sources for Matlab, Python and R interfaces)\n\n> SPAMS-related git repositories are also available on [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/) [gitlab forge](https://gitlab.inria.fr/): see [original C++ project](https://gitlab.inria.fr/thoth/spams-devel)  (and original sources for Matlab, Python and R interfaces), [Python specific project](https://gitlab.inria.fr/thoth/spams-python)\n\n\n## Contact\n\nRegarding SPAMS **Python** package: you can open an issue on the dedicated git project at <https://github.com/getspams/spams-python>\n\nRegarding SPAMS **R** package: you can open an issue on the dedicated git project at <https://github.com/getspams/spams-R>\n\nFor any other question related to the use or development of SPAMS:\n\n- you can you can contact us at `spams.dev'AT'inria.fr` (replace `'AT'` by `@`)\n- you can open an issue on the general git project at <https://github.com/getspams/spams-devel>\n\n---\n\n## Authorship\n\nSPAMS is developed and maintained by [Julien Mairal](http://julien.mairal.org) (Inria), and contains sparse estimation methods resulting from collaborations with various people: notably, [Francis Bach](http://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach), [Jean Ponce](http://www.di.ens.fr/~ponce), Guillermo Sapiro, [Rodolphe Jenatton](http://www.di.ens.fr/~jenatton/) and [Guillaume Obozinski](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~obozinsg/).\n\nIt is coded in C++ with a Matlab interface. Interfaces for R and Python have been developed by Jean-Paul Chieze, and archetypal analysis was written by Yuansi Chen.\n\nRelease of version 2.6/2.6.1 and porting to R-3.x and Python3.x was done by [Ghislain Durif](https://gdurif.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) (Inria). The original porting to Python3.x is based on [this patch](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-spams-svn/) and on the work of John Kirkham available [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/python-spams-feedstock).\n\nVersion 2.6.2 (Python only) update is based on contributions by [Francois Rheault](https://github.com/frheault) and [Samuel Saint-Jean](http://samuelstjean.github.io/).\n\n### Maintenance\n\nSince version 2.6.3+, SPAMS (especially the Python version) is now maintained by the following team:\n\n- [Alessandro Daducci](https://github.com/daducci)\n- [Ghislain Durif](https://gdurif.perso.math.cnrs.fr/)\n- [Francois Rheault](https://github.com/frheault)\n- [Samuel Saint-Jean](http://samuelstjean.github.io/)\n\n---\n\n## Funding\n\nThis work was supported in part by the SIERRA and VIDEOWORLD ERC projects, and by the MACARON ANR project.\n\n## License\n\nVersion 2.1 and later are open-source under [GPLv3 licence](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).
