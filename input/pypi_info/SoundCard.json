Instead, it is implemented using the wonderful `CFFI\n<http://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ and the native audio libraries of\nLinux, Windows and macOS.\n\nThe input and output data are scaled to 0dBFS (Full Scale). To avoid clipping  \nrestrict all data between -1 and 1.\n\nSoundCard is cross-platform, and supports Linux/pulseaudio, Mac/coreaudio, and\nWindows/WASAPI. While the programming interface is identical across platforms,\nsound card naming schemes and default block sizes can vary between devices and\nplatforms. \n\nSoundCard is still in development. All major features work on all platforms, but\nthere are a few known issues that still need to be fixed. If you find a bug,\nplease open an Issue, and I will try to fix it. Or open a Pull Request, and I\nwill try to include your fix into SoundCard.\n\nHowever, please be aware that this is a hobby project of mine that I am\ndeveloping for free, and in my spare time. While I try to be as accomodating as\npossible, I can not guarantee a timely response to issues. Publishing Open\nSource Software on Github does not imply an obligation to *fix your problem\nright now*.

All data passed in and out of these objects\nare *frames × channels* Numpy arrays.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import numpy\n\n    >>> print(default_speaker)\n    <Speaker Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (2 channels)>\n    >>> print(default_mic)\n    <Microphone Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (2 channels)>\n\n    # record and play back one second of audio:\n    data = default_mic.record(samplerate=48000, numframes=48000)\n    # normalized playback\n    default_speaker.play(data/numpy.max(numpy.abs(data)), samplerate=48000)\n\n    # alternatively, get a `Recorder` and `Player` object\n    # and play or record continuously:\n    with default_mic.recorder(samplerate=48000) as mic, \\\n          default_speaker.player(samplerate=48000) as sp:\n        for _ in range(100):\n            data = mic.record(numframes=1024)\n            sp.play(data)\n\nLatency\n-------\n\nBy default, SoundCard records and plays at the operating system's default\nconfiguration. Particularly on laptops, this configuration might have extreme\nlatencies, up to multiple seconds.\n\nIn order to request lower latencies, pass a ``blocksize`` to ``player`` or\n``recorder``. This tells the operating system your desired latency, and it will\ntry to honor your request as best it can. On Windows/WASAPI, setting\n``exclusive_mode=True`` might help, too (this is currently experimental).\n\nAnother source of latency is in the ``record`` function, which buffers output up\nto the requested ``numframes``. In general, for optimal latency, you should use\na ``numframes`` significantly lower than the ``blocksize`` above, maybe by a\nfactor of two or four.\n\nTo get the audio data as quickly as absolutely possible, you can use\n``numframes=None``, which will return whatever audio data is available right\nnow, without any buffering. Note that this might receive different numbers of\nframes each time.\n\nWith the above settings, block sizes of 256 samples or ten milliseconds are\nusually no problem. The total latency of playback and recording is dependent on\nhow these buffers are handled by the operating system, though, and might be\nsignificantly higher.\n\nAdditionally, it might help to experiment with advice from here: https://askubuntu.com/questions/707171/how-can-i-fix-choppy-audio and edit your /etc/pulse/default.pa file to replace the line saying ::\n\n    load-module module-udev-detect\n\nwith ::\n\n    load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0\n\nand then do not forget to restart pulseaudio with ::\n\n    pulseaudio -k\n\n\nChannel Maps\n------------\n\nSome professional sound cards have large numbers of channels. If you want to\nrecord or play only a subset of those channels, you can specify a channel map.\nA channel map consists of a list of channel specifiers, which refer to the\nchannels of the audio backend in use. The index of each of those specifiers\nin the the channel map list indicates the channel index in the numpy data array\nused in SoundCard:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # record one second of audio from backend channels 0 to 3:\n    data = default_mic.record(samplerate=48000, channels=[0, 1, 2, 3], numframes=48000)\n\n    # play back the recorded audio in reverse channel order:\n    default_speaker.play(data=data, channels=[3, 2, 1, 0], samplerate=48000)\n\n\nThe meaning of the channel specifiers depend on the backend in use. For WASAPI\n(Windows) and CoreAudio (macOS) the indices refer to the physical output\nchannels of the sound device in use. For the PulseAudio backend (Linux) the\nspecifiers refer to logical channel positions instead of physical hardware\nchannels.\n\nThe channel position identifiers in the PulseAudio backend are based on:\nhttps://freedesktop.org/software/pulseaudio/doxygen/channelmap_8h.html\nSince the mapping of position indices to audio channels is not obvious, a\ndictionary containing all possible positions and channel indices can be\nretrieved by calling ``channel_name_map()``. The positions for the indices up to 10 are: ::\n\n    'mono': -1,\n    'left': 0,\n    'right': 1,\n    'center': 2,\n    'rear-center': 3,\n    'rear-left': 4,\n    'rear-right': 5,\n    'lfe': 6,\n    'front-left-of-center': 7,\n    'front-right-of-center': 8,\n    'side-left': 9,\n    'side-right': 10\n\nThe identifier ``mono`` or the index ``-1`` can be used for mono mix of all\nchannels for both playback and recording. (CoreAudio/macOS defines channel ``-1``\nas silence for both playback and recording.) In addition to the indices, the PulseAudio\nbackend allows the use of the name strings to define a channel map:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    # This example plays one second of noise on each channel defined in the channel map consecutively.\n    # The channel definition scheme using strings only works with the PulseAudio backend!\n\n    # This defines a channel map for a 7.1 audio sink device\n    channel_map = ['left', 'right', 'center', 'lfe', 'rear-left', 'rear-right', 'side-left', 'side-right']\n\n    num_channels = len(channel_map)\n    samplerate = 48000\n\n    # Create the multi channel noise array.\n    noise_samples = 48000\n    noise = numpy.random.uniform(-0.1, 0.1, noise_samples)\n    data = numpy.zeros((num_channels * noise_samples, num_channels), dtype=numpy.float32)\n    for channel in range(num_channels):\n        data[channel * noise_samples:(channel + 1) * noise_samples, channel] = noise\n\n    # Playback using the 7.1 channel map.\n    default_speaker.play(data=data, channels=channel_map, samplerate=samplerate)\n\nThe available channels of each PulseAudio source or sink can be listed by ::\n\n    > pactl list sinks\n    > pactl list sources\n\n\nThe ``Channel Map`` property lists the channel identifier of the source/sink. ::\n\n    > pactl list sinks | grep  \"Channel Map\" -B 6\n    \n    Sink #486\n        State: SUSPENDED\n        Name: alsa_output.usb-C-Media_Electronics_Inc._USB_Advanced_Audio_Device-00.analog-stereo\n        Description: USB Advanced Audio Device Analog Stereo\n        Driver: PipeWire\n        Sample Specification: s24le 2ch 48000Hz\n        Channel Map: front-left,front-right\n    --\n    Sink #488\n            State: RUNNING\n            Name: alsa_output.pci-0000_2f_00.4.analog-surround-71\n            Description: Starship/Matisse HD Audio Controller Analog Surround 7.1\n            Driver: PipeWire\n            Sample Specification: s32le 8ch 48000Hz\n            Channel Map: front-left,front-right,rear-left,rear-right,front-center,lfe,side-left,side-right\n\n\nFAQ\n---\nQ: How to make it work on a headless Raspberry Pi?\n\nA: PulseAudio is not installed by default on the Raspberry Pi OS Lite distribution (https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/operating-systems/). In order to use ``soundcard``, you have to install PulseAudio first, and edit the configuration (with a fix to avoid the main output to be in mono-only). ::\n\n    sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-numpy pulseaudio\n    sudo nano /usr/share/pulseaudio/alsa-mixer/profile-sets/default.conf\n    # comment the block [Mapping analog-mono] with ';'\n    pulseaudio -D\n    python3 -m pip install soundcard\n\n\nKnown Issues:\n-------------\n\n* Windows/WASAPI currently records garbage if you record only a single channel.\n  The reason for this is yet unknown. Multi-channel and channel maps work,\n  though.\n* Windows/WASAPI silently ignores the blocksize in some cases. Apparently, it\n  only supports variable block sizes in exclusive mode.\n* Windows/WASAPI may underrun its buffers even if blocksize and nframes are\n  matched. Use a larger blocksize than nframes if this happens.\n* Error messages often report some internal CFFI/backend errors. This will be\n  improved in the future.\n* macOS Records silence happens when you run your script with an app that doesn't\n  ask for microphone permission to solve it, go to settings and give microphone\n  permission to the app you are running the script.\n\nChangelog\n---------\n\n- 2018-04-25 implements fixed block sizes when recording\n  (thank you, Pariente Manuel!)\n- 2018-05-10 adds a test suite and various fixes for Windows\n- 2018-05-11 various fixes for macOS\n- 2018-06-27 Adds latency property to Linux/pulseaudio\n  (Thank you, Pariente Manuel!)\n- 2018-07-17 adds loopback support for Windows\n  (Thank you, Jan Leskovec!)\n- 2018-10-16 adds bug fix for IPython on Windows\n  (Thank you, Sebastian Michel!)\n- 2018-11-28 adds Sphinx/Readthedocs documentation\n- 2019-03-25 adds support for Python 3.5\n  (Thank you, Daniel R.
