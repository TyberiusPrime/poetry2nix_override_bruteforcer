It will\nlikely work fine on most UNIX systems.\n\nSupervisor will not run at all under any version of Windows.\n\nSupervisor is intended to work on Python 3 version 3.4 or later\nand on Python 2 version 2.7.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nYou can view the current Supervisor documentation online `in HTML format\n<http://supervisord.org/>`_ .  This is where you should go for detailed\ninstallation and configuration documentation.\n\nReporting Bugs and Viewing the Source Repository\n------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease report bugs in the `GitHub issue tracker\n<https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues>`_.\n\nYou can view the source repository for supervisor via\n`https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor\n<https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor>`_.\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nWe'll review contributions from the community in\n`pull requests <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_\non GitHub.\n\n\n4.2.5 (2022-12-23)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug where the XML-RPC method ``supervisor.startProcess()`` would\n  return 500 Internal Server Error instead of an XML-RPC fault response\n  if the command could not be parsed.  Patch by Julien Le Cléach.\n\n- Fixed a bug on Python 2.7 where a ``UnicodeDecodeError`` may have occurred\n  when using the web interface.  Patch by Vinay Sajip.\n\n- Removed use of ``urllib.parse`` functions ``splithost``, ``splitport``, and\n  ``splittype`` deprecated in Python 3.8.\n\n- Removed use of ``asynchat`` and ``asyncore`` deprecated in Python 3.10.\n\n- The return value of the XML-RPC method ``supervisor.getAllConfigInfo()``\n  now includes the ``directory``, ``uid``, and ``serverurl`` of the\n  program.  Patch by Yellmean.\n\n- If a subprocess exits with a unexpected exit code (one not listed in\n  ``exitcodes=`` in a ``[program:x]`` section) then the exit will now be logged\n  at the ``WARN`` level instead of ``INFO``.  Patch by Precy Lee.\n\n- ``supervisorctl shutdown`` now shows an error message if an argument is\n  given.\n\n- File descriptors are now closed using the faster ``os.closerange()`` instead\n  of calling ``os.close()`` in a loop.  Patch by tyong920.\n\n4.2.4 (2021-12-30)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug where the ``--identifier`` command line argument was ignored.\n  It was broken since at least 3.0a7 (released in 2009) and probably earlier.\n  Patch by Julien Le Cléach.\n\n4.2.3 (2021-12-27)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a race condition where an ``rpcinterface`` extension that subscribed\n  to events would not see the correct process state if it accessed the\n  the ``state`` attribute on a ``Subprocess`` instance immediately in the\n  event callback.  Patch by Chao Wang.\n\n- Added the ``setuptools`` package to the list of dependencies in\n  ``setup.py`` because it is a runtime dependency.  Patch by Louis Sautier.\n\n- The web interface will now return a 404 Not Found response if a log file\n  is missing.  Previously, it would return 410 Gone.  It was changed because\n  410 is intended to mean that the condition is likely to be permanent.  A\n  log file missing is usually temporary, e.g. a process that was never started\n  will not have a log file but will have one as soon as it is started.\n\n4.2.2 (2021-02-26)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug where ``supervisord`` could crash if a subprocess exited\n  immediately before trying to kill it.\n\n- Fixed a bug where the ``stdout_syslog`` and ``stderr_syslog`` options\n  of a ``[program:x]`` section could not be used unless file logging for\n  the same program had also been configured.  The file and syslog options\n  can now be used independently.  Patch by Scott Stroupe.\n\n- Fixed a bug where the ``logfile`` option in the ``[supervisord]``\n  section would not log to syslog when the special filename of\n  ``syslog`` was supplied, as is supported by all other log filename\n  options.  Patch by Franck Cuny.\n\n- Fixed a bug where environment variables defined in ``environment=``\n  in the ``[supervisord]`` section or a ``[program:x]`` section could\n  not be used in ``%(ENV_x)s`` expansions.  Patch by MythRen.\n\n- The  ``supervisorctl signal`` command now allows a signal to be sent\n  when a process is in the ``STOPPING`` state.  Patch by Mike Gould.\n\n- ``supervisorctl`` and ``supervisord`` now print help when given ``-?``\n  in addition to the existing ``-h``/``--help``.\n\n4.2.1 (2020-08-20)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug on Python 3 where a network error could cause ``supervisord``\n  to crash with the error ``<class 'TypeError'>:can't concat str to bytes``.\n  Patch by Vinay Sajip.\n\n- Fixed a bug where a test would fail on systems with glibc 2.3.1 because\n  the default value of SOMAXCONN changed.\n\n4.2.0 (2020-04-30)\n------------------\n\n- When ``supervisord`` is run in the foreground, a new ``--silent`` option\n  suppresses the main log from being echoed to ``stdout`` as it normally\n  would.  Patch by Trevor Foster.\n\n- Parsing ``command=`` now supports a new expansion, ``%(numprocs)d``, that\n  expands to the value of ``numprocs=`` in the same section.  Patch by\n  Santjago Corkez.\n\n- Web UI buttons no longer use background images.  Patch by Dmytro Karpovych.\n\n- The Web UI now has a link to view ``tail -f stderr`` for a process in\n  addition to the existing ``tail -f stdout`` link.  Based on a\n  patch by OuroborosCoding.\n\n- The HTTP server will now send an ``X-Accel-Buffering: no`` header in\n  logtail responses to fix Nginx proxy buffering.  Patch by Weizhao Li.\n\n- When ``supervisord`` reaps an unknown PID, it will now log a description\n  of the ``waitpid`` status.  Patch by Andrey Zelenchuk.\n\n- Fixed a bug introduced in 4.0.3 where ``supervisorctl tail -f foo | grep bar``\n  would fail with the error ``NoneType object has no attribute 'lower'``.  This\n  only occurred on Python 2.7 and only when piped.  Patch by Slawa Pidgorny.\n\n4.1.0 (2019-10-19)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug on Python 3 only where logging to syslog did not work and\n  would log the exception ``TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'``\n  to the main ``supervisord`` log file.  Patch by Vinay Sajip and Josh Staley.\n\n- Fixed a Python 3.8 compatibility issue caused by the removal of\n  ``cgi.escape()``.  Patch by Mattia Procopio.\n\n- The ``meld3`` package is no longer a dependency.  A version of ``meld3``\n  is now included within the ``supervisor`` package itself.\n\n4.0.4 (2019-07-15)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug where ``supervisorctl tail <name> stdout`` would actually tail\n  ``stderr``.  Note that ``tail <name>`` without the explicit ``stdout``\n  correctly tailed ``stdout``.  The bug existed since 3.0a3 (released in\n  2007).  Patch by Arseny Hofman.\n\n- Improved the warning message added in 4.0.3 so it is now emitted for\n  both ``tail`` and ``tail -f``.  Patch by Vinay Sajip.\n\n- CVE-2019-12105.  Documentation addition only, no code changes.  This CVE\n  states that ``inet_http_server`` does not use authentication by default\n  (`details <https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/1245>`_).  Note that\n  ``inet_http_server`` is not enabled by default, and is also not enabled\n  in the example configuration output by ``echo_supervisord_conf``.  The\n  behavior of the ``inet_http_server`` options have been correctly documented,\n  and have not changed, since the feature was introduced in 2006.  A new\n  `warning message <https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/commit/4e334d9cf2a1daff685893e35e72398437df3dcb>`_\n  was added to the documentation.\n\n4.0.3 (2019-05-22)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed an issue on Python 2 where running ``supervisorctl tail -f <name>``\n  would fail with the message\n  ``Cannot connect, error: <type 'exceptions.UnicodeEncodeError'>`` where it\n  may have worked on Supervisor 3.x.  The issue was introduced in Supervisor\n  4.0.0 due to new bytes/strings conversions necessary to add Python 3 support.\n  For ``supervisorctl`` to correctly display logs with Unicode characters, the\n  terminal encoding specified by the environment must support it.  If not, the\n  ``UnicodeEncodeError`` may still occur on either Python 2 or 3.  A new\n  warning message is now printed if a problematic terminal encoding is\n  detected.  Patch by Vinay Sajip.\n\n4.0.2 (2019-04-17)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug where inline comments in the config file were not parsed\n  correctly such that the comments were included as part of the values.\n  This only occurred on Python 2, and only where the environment had an\n  extra ``configparser`` module installed.  The bug was introduced in\n  Supervisor 4.0.0 because of Python 2/3 compatibility code that expected\n  a Python 2 environment to only have a ``ConfigParser`` module.\n\n4.0.1 (2019-04-10)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed an issue on Python 3 where an ``OSError: [Errno 29] Illegal seek``\n  would occur if ``logfile`` in the ``[supervisord]`` section was set to\n  a special file like ``/dev/stdout`` that was not seekable, even if\n  ``logfile_maxbytes = 0`` was set to disable rotation.  The issue only\n  affected the main log and not child logs.  Patch by Martin Falatic.\n\n4.0.0 (2019-04-05)\n------------------\n\n- Support for Python 3 has been added.  On Python 3, Supervisor requires\n  Python 3.4 or later.  Many thanks to Vinay Sajip, Scott Maxwell, Palm Kevin,\n  Tres Seaver, Marc Abramowitz, Son Nguyen, Shane Hathaway, Evan Andrews,\n  and Ethan Hann who all made major contributions to the Python 3 porting\n  effort.  Thanks also to all contributors who submitted issue reports and\n  patches towards this effort.\n\n- Support for Python 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 has been dropped.  On Python 2,\n  Supervisor now requires Python 2.7.\n\n- The ``supervisor`` package is no longer a namespace package.\n\n- The behavior of the config file expansion ``%(here)s`` has changed.  In\n  previous versions, a bug caused ``%(here)s`` to always expand to the\n  directory of the root config file.  Now, when ``%(here)s`` is used inside\n  a file included via ``[include]``, it will expand to the directory of\n  that file.  Thanks to Alex Eftimie and Zoltan Toth-Czifra for the patches.\n\n- The default value for the config file setting ``exitcodes=``, the expected\n  exit codes of a program, has changed.  In previous versions, it was ``0,2``.\n  This caused issues with Golang programs where ``panic()`` causes the exit\n  code to be ``2``.  The default value for ``exitcodes`` is now ``0``.\n\n- An undocumented feature where multiple ``supervisorctl`` commands could be\n  combined on a single line separated by semicolons has been removed.\n\n- ``supervisorctl`` will now set its exit code to a non-zero value when an\n  error condition occurs.  Previous versions did not set the exit code for\n  most error conditions so it was almost always 0.  Patch by Luke Weber.\n\n- Added new ``stdout_syslog`` and ``stderr_syslog`` options to the config\n  file.  These are boolean options that indicate whether process output will\n  be sent to syslog.  Supervisor can now log to both files and syslog at the\n  same time.  Specifying a log filename of ``syslog`` is still supported\n  but deprecated.  Patch by Jason R. Coombs.\n\n3.4.0 (2019-04-05)\n------------------\n\n- FastCGI programs (``[fcgi-program:x]`` sections) can now be used in\n  groups (``[group:x]``).  Patch by Florian Apolloner.\n\n- Added a new ``socket_backlog`` option to the ``[fcgi-program:x]`` section\n  to set the listen(2) socket backlog.  Patch by Nenad Merdanovic.\n\n- Fixed a bug where ``SupervisorTransport`` (the XML-RPC transport used with\n  Unix domain sockets) did not close the connection when ``close()`` was\n  called on it.  Patch by Jérome Perrin.\n\n- Fixed a bug where ``supervisorctl start <name>`` could hang for a long time\n  if the system clock rolled back.  Patch by Joe LeVeque.\n\n3.3.5 (2018-12-22)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a race condition where ``supervisord`` would cancel a shutdown\n  already in progress if it received ``SIGHUP``.  Now, ``supervisord`` will\n  ignore ``SIGHUP`` if shutdown is already in progress.  Patch by Livanh.\n\n- Fixed a bug where searching for a relative command ignored changes to\n  ``PATH`` made in ``environment=``.  Based on a patch by dongweiming.\n\n- ``childutils.ProcessCommunicationsProtocol`` now does an explicit\n  ``flush()`` after writing to ``stdout``.\n\n- A more descriptive error message is now emitted if a name in the config\n  file contains a disallowed character.  Patch by Rick van Hattem.\n\n3.3.4 (2018-02-15)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug where rereading the configuration would not detect changes to\n  eventlisteners.  Patch by Michael Ihde.\n\n- Fixed a bug where the warning ``Supervisord is running as root and it is\n  searching for its config file`` may have been incorrectly shown by\n  ``supervisorctl`` if its executable name was changed.\n\n- Fixed a bug where ``supervisord`` would continue starting up if the\n  ``[supervisord]`` section of the config file specified ``user=`` but\n  ``setuid()`` to that user failed.  It will now exit immediately if it\n  cannot drop privileges.\n\n- Fixed a bug in the web interface where redirect URLs did not have a slash\n  between the host and query string, which caused issues when proxying with\n  Nginx.  Patch by Luke Weber.\n\n- When ``supervisord`` successfully drops privileges during startup, it is now\n  logged at the ``INFO`` level instead of ``CRIT``.\n\n- The HTTP server now returns a Content-Type header specifying UTF-8 encoding.\n  This may fix display issues in some browsers.  Patch by Katenkka.\n\n3.3.3 (2017-07-24)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed CVE-2017-11610.  A vulnerability was found where an authenticated\n  client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to ``supervisord`` that will\n  run arbitrary shell commands on the server.  The commands will be run as\n  the same user as ``supervisord``.  Depending on how ``supervisord`` has been\n  configured, this may be root.  See\n  https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.\n\n3.3.2 (2017-06-03)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.3.0 where the ``supervisorctl reload`` command\n  would crash ``supervisord`` with the error ``OSError: [Errno 9] Bad file\n  descriptor`` if the ``kqueue`` poller was used.  Patch by Jared Suttles.\n\n- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.3.0 where ``supervisord`` could get stuck in a\n  polling loop after the web interface was used, causing high CPU usage.\n  Patch by Jared Suttles.\n\n- Fixed a bug where if ``supervisord`` attempted to start but aborted due to\n  another running instance of ``supervisord`` with the same config, the\n  pidfile of the running instance would be deleted.  Patch by coldnight.\n\n- Fixed a bug where ``supervisorctl fg`` would swallow most XML-RPC faults.\n  ``fg`` now prints the fault and exits.\n\n- Parsing the config file will now fail with an error message if a process\n  or group name contains a forward slash character (``/``) since it would\n  break the URLs used by the web interface.\n\n- ``supervisorctl reload`` now shows an error message if an argument is\n  given.  Patch by Joel Krauska.\n\n- ``supervisorctl`` commands ``avail``, ``reread``, and ``version`` now show\n  an error message if an argument is given.\n\n3.3.1 (2016-08-02)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed an issue where ``supervisord`` could hang when responding to HTTP\n  requests (including ``supervisorctl`` commands) if the system time was set\n  back after ``supervisord`` was started.\n\n- Zope ``trackrefs``, a debugging tool that was included in the ``tests``\n  directory but hadn't been used for years, has been removed.\n\n3.3.0 (2016-05-14)\n------------------\n\n- ``supervisord`` will now use ``kqueue``, ``poll``, or ``select`` to monitor\n  its file descriptors, in that order, depending on what is available on the\n  system.  Previous versions used ``select`` only and would crash with the error\n  ``ValueError: filedescriptor out of range in select()`` when running a large\n  number of subprocesses (whatever number resulted in enough file descriptors\n  to exceed the fixed-size file descriptor table used by ``select``, which is\n  typically 1024).  Patch by Igor Sobreira.\n\n- ``/etc/supervisor/supervisord.conf`` has been added to the config file search\n  paths.  Many versions of Supervisor packaged for Debian and Ubuntu have\n  included a patch that added this path.  This difference was reported in a\n  number of tickets as a source of confusion and upgrade difficulties, so the\n  path has been added.  Patch by Kelvin Wong.\n\n- Glob patterns in the ``[include]`` section now support the\n  ``host_node_name`` expansion.  Patch by Paul Lockaby.\n\n- Files included via the ``[include]`` section are now logged at the ``INFO``\n  level instead of ``WARN``.  Patch by Daniel Hahler.\n\n3.2.4 (2017-07-24)\n------------------\n\n- Backported from Supervisor 3.3.3:  Fixed CVE-2017-11610.  A vulnerability\n  was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request\n  to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server.\n  The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``.  Depending on\n  how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root.  See\n  https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.\n\n3.2.3 (2016-03-19)\n------------------\n\n- 400 Bad Request is now returned if an XML-RPC request is received with\n  invalid body data.  In previous versions, 500 Internal Server Error\n  was returned.\n\n3.2.2 (2016-03-04)\n------------------\n\n- Parsing the config file will now fail with an error message if an\n  ``inet_http_server`` or ``unix_http_server`` section contains a ``username=``\n  but no ``password=``.  In previous versions, ``supervisord`` would start with\n  this invalid configuration but the HTTP server would always return a 500\n  Internal Server Error.  Thanks to Chris Ergatides for reporting this issue.\n\n3.2.1 (2016-02-06)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a server exception ``OverflowError: int exceeds XML-RPC limits`` that\n  made ``supervisorctl status`` unusable if the system time was far into the\n  future.  The XML-RPC API returns timestamps as XML-RPC integers, but\n  timestamps will exceed the maximum value of an XML-RPC integer in January\n  2038 (\"Year 2038 Problem\").  For now, timestamps exceeding the maximum\n  integer will be capped at the maximum to avoid the exception and retain\n  compatibility with existing API clients.  In a future version of the API,\n  the return type for timestamps will be changed.\n\n3.2.0 (2015-11-30)\n------------------\n\n- Files included via the ``[include]`` section are read in sorted order.  In\n  past versions, the order was undefined.  Patch by Ionel Cristian Mărieș.\n\n- ``supervisorctl start`` and ``supervisorctl stop`` now complete more quickly\n  when handling many processes.  Thanks to Chris McDonough for this patch.\n  See: https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/131\n\n- Environment variables are now expanded for all config file options.\n  Patch by Dexter Tad-y.\n\n- Added ``signalProcess``, ``signalProcessGroup``, and ``signalAllProcesses``\n  XML-RPC methods to supervisor RPC interface.  Thanks to Casey Callendrello,\n  Marc Abramowitz, and Moriyoshi Koizumi for the patches.\n\n- Added ``signal`` command to supervisorctl.  Thanks to Moriyoshi Koizumi and\n  Marc Abramowitz for the patches.\n\n- Errors caused by bad values in a config file now show the config section\n  to make debugging easier.  Patch by Marc Abramowitz.\n\n- Setting ``redirect_stderr=true`` in an ``[eventlistener:x]`` section is now\n  disallowed because any messages written to ``stderr`` would interfere\n  with the eventlistener protocol on ``stdout``.\n\n- Fixed a bug where spawning a process could cause ``supervisord`` to crash\n  if an ``IOError`` occurred while setting up logging.  One way this could\n  happen is if a log filename was accidentally set to a directory instead\n  of a file.  Thanks to Grzegorz Nosek for reporting this issue.\n\n- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.1.0 where ``supervisord`` could crash when\n  attempting to display a resource limit error.\n\n- Fixed a bug where ``supervisord`` could crash with the message\n  ``Assertion failed for processname: RUNNING not in STARTING`` if a time\n  change caused the last start time of the process to be in the future.\n  Thanks to Róbert Nagy, Sergey Leschenko, and samhair for the patches.\n\n- A warning is now logged if an eventlistener enters the UNKNOWN state,\n  which usually indicates a bug in the eventlistener.  Thanks to Steve\n  Winton and detailyang for reporting issues that led to this change.\n\n- Errors from the web interface are now logged at the ``ERROR`` level.\n  Previously, they were logged at the ``TRACE`` level and easily\n  missed.  Thanks to Thomas Güttler for reporting this issue.\n\n- Fixed ``DeprecationWarning: Parameters to load are deprecated. Call\n  .resolve and .require separately.`` on setuptools >= 11.3.\n\n- If ``redirect_stderr=true`` and ``stderr_logfile=auto``, no stderr log\n  file will be created.  In previous versions, an empty stderr log file\n  would be created.  Thanks to Łukasz Kożuchowski for the initial patch.\n\n- Fixed an issue in Medusa that would cause ``supervisorctl tail -f`` to\n  disconnect if many other ``supervisorctl`` commands were run in parallel.\n  Patch by Stefan Friesel.\n\n3.1.4 (2017-07-24)\n------------------\n\n- Backported from Supervisor 3.3.3:  Fixed CVE-2017-11610.  A vulnerability\n  was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request\n  to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server.\n  The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``.  Depending on\n  how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root.  See\n  https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.\n\n3.1.3 (2014-10-28)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where the ElementTree-based parser handled strings\n  like ``<value><string>hello</string></value>`` but not strings like\n  ``<value>hello</value>``, which are valid in the XML-RPC spec.  This\n  fixes compatibility with the Apache XML-RPC client for Java and\n  possibly other clients.\n\n3.1.2 (2014-09-07)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug where ``tail group:*`` in ``supervisorctl`` would show a 500\n  Internal Server Error rather than a BAD_NAME fault.\n\n- Fixed a bug where the web interface would show a 500 Internal Server Error\n  instead of an error message for some process start faults.\n\n- Removed medusa files not used by Supervisor.\n\n3.1.1 (2014-08-11)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug where ``supervisorctl tail -f name`` output would stop if log\n  rotation occurred while tailing.\n\n- Prevent a crash when a greater number of file descriptors were attempted to\n  be opened than permitted by the environment when starting a bunch of\n  programs.  Now, instead a spawn error is logged.\n\n- Compute \"channel delay\" properly, fixing symptoms where a supervisorctl\n  start command would hang for a very long time when a process (or many\n  processes) are spewing to their stdout or stderr.  See comments attached to\n  https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/pull/263 .\n\n- Added ``docs/conf.py``, ``docs/Makefile``, and ``supervisor/scripts/*.py``\n  to the release package.\n\n3.1.0 (2014-07-29)\n------------------\n\n- The output of the ``start``, ``stop``, ``restart``, and ``clear`` commands\n  in ``supervisorctl`` has been changed to be consistent with the ``status``\n  command.  Previously, the ``status`` command would show a process like\n  ``foo:foo_01`` but starting that process would show ``foo_01: started``\n  (note the group prefix ``foo:`` was missing).  Now, starting the process\n  will show ``foo:foo_01: started``.  Suggested by Chris Wood.\n\n- The ``status`` command in ``supervisorctl`` now supports group name\n  syntax: ``status group:*``.\n\n- The process column in the table output by the ``status`` command in\n  ``supervisorctl`` now expands to fit the widest name.\n\n- The ``update`` command in ``supervisorctl`` now accepts optional group\n  names.  When group names are specified, only those groups will be\n  updated.  Patch by Gary M. Josack.\n\n- Tab completion in ``supervisorctl`` has been improved and now works for\n  more cases.  Thanks to Mathieu Longtin and Marc Abramowitz for the patches.\n\n- Attempting to start or stop a process group in ``supervisorctl`` with the\n  ``group:*`` syntax will now show the same error message as the ``process``\n  syntax if the name does not exist.  Previously, it would show a Python\n  exception.  Patch by George Ang.\n\n- Added new ``PROCESS_GROUP_ADDED`` and ``PROCESS_GROUP_REMOVED`` events.\n  These events are fired when process groups are added or removed from\n  Supervisor's runtime configuration when using the ``add`` and ``remove``\n  commands in ``supervisorctl``.  Patch by Brent Tubbs.\n\n- Stopping a process in the backoff state now changes it to the stopped\n  state.  Previously, an attempt to stop a process in backoff would be\n  ignored.  Patch by Pascal Varet.\n\n- The ``directory`` option is now expanded separately for each process in\n  a homogeneous process group.  This allows each process to have its own\n  working directory.  Patch by Perttu Ranta-aho.\n\n- Removed ``setuptools`` from the ``requires`` list in ``setup.py`` because\n  it caused installation issues on some systems.\n\n- Fixed a bug in Medusa where the HTTP Basic authorizer would cause an\n  exception if the password contained a colon.  Thanks to Thomas Güttler\n  for reporting this issue.\n\n- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where calling supervisor.clearProcessLogs() with a\n  name like ``group:*`` would cause a 500 Internal Server Error rather than\n  returning a BAD_NAME fault.\n\n- Fixed a hang that could occur in ``supervisord`` if log rotation is used\n  and an outside program deletes an active log file.  Patch by Magnus Lycka.\n\n- A warning is now logged if a glob pattern in an ``[include]`` section does\n  not match any files.  Patch by Daniel Hahler.\n\n3.0.1 (2017-07-24)\n------------------\n\n- Backported from Supervisor 3.3.3:  Fixed CVE-2017-11610.  A vulnerability\n  was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request\n  to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server.\n  The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``.  Depending on\n  how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root.  See\n  https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.\n\n3.0 (2013-07-30)\n----------------\n\n- Parsing the config file will now fail with an error message if a process\n  or group name contains characters that are not compatible with the\n  eventlistener protocol.\n\n- Fixed a bug where the ``tail -f`` command in ``supervisorctl`` would fail\n  if the combined length of the username and password was over 56 characters.\n\n- Reading the config file now gives a separate error message when the config\n  file exists but can't be read.  Previously, any error reading the file\n  would be reported as \"could not find config file\".  Patch by Jens Rantil.\n\n- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where array elements after the first would be ignored\n  when using the ElementTree-based XML parser.  Patch by Zev Benjamin.\n\n- Fixed the usage message output by ``supervisorctl`` to show the correct\n  default config file path.  Patch by Alek Storm.\n\n3.0b2 (2013-05-28)\n------------------\n\n- The behavior of the program option ``user`` has changed.  In all previous\n  versions, if ``supervisord`` failed to switch to the user, a warning would\n  be sent to the stderr log but the child process would still be spawned.\n  This means that a mistake in the config file could result in a child\n  process being unintentionally spawned as root.  Now, ``supervisord`` will\n  not spawn the child unless it was able to successfully switch to the user.\n  Thanks to Igor Partola for reporting this issue.\n\n- If a user specified in the config file does not exist on the system,\n  ``supervisord`` will now print an error and refuse to start.\n\n- Reverted a change to logging introduced in 3.0b1 that was intended to allow\n  multiple processes to log to the same file with the rotating log handler.\n  The implementation caused supervisord to crash during reload and to leak\n  file handles.  Also, since log rotation options are given on a per-program\n  basis, impossible configurations could be created (conflicting rotation\n  options for the same file).  Given this and that supervisord now has syslog\n  support, it was decided to remove this feature.  A warning was added to the\n  documentation that two processes may not log to the same file.\n\n- Fixed a bug where parsing ``command=`` could cause supervisord to crash if\n  shlex.split() fails, such as a bad quoting.  Patch by Scott Wilson.\n\n- It is now possible to use ``supervisorctl`` on a machine with no\n  ``supervisord.conf`` file by supplying the connection information in\n  command line options.  Patch by Jens Rantil.\n\n- Fixed a bug where supervisord would crash if the syslog handler was used\n  and supervisord received SIGUSR2 (log reopen request).\n\n- Fixed an XML-RPC bug where calling supervisor.getProcessInfo() with a bad\n  name would cause a 500 Internal Server Error rather than the returning\n  a BAD_NAME fault.\n\n- Added a favicon to the web interface.  Patch by Caio Ariede.\n\n- Fixed a test failure due to incorrect handling of daylight savings time\n  in the childutils tests.  Patch by Ildar Hizbulin.\n\n- Fixed a number of pyflakes warnings for unused variables, imports, and\n  dead code.  Patch by Philippe Ombredanne.\n\n3.0b1 (2012-09-10)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug where parsing ``environment=`` did not verify that key/value\n  pairs were correctly separated.  Patch by Martijn Pieters.\n\n- Fixed a bug in the HTTP server code that could cause unnecessary delays\n  when sending large responses.  Patch by Philip Zeyliger.\n\n- When supervisord starts up as root, if the ``-c`` flag was not provided, a\n  warning is now emitted to the console.  Rationale: supervisord looks in the\n  current working directory for a ``supervisord.conf`` file; someone might\n  trick the root user into starting supervisord while cd'ed into a directory\n  that has a rogue ``supervisord.conf``.\n\n- A warning was added to the documentation about the security implications of\n  starting supervisord without the ``-c`` flag.\n\n- Add a boolean program option ``stopasgroup``, defaulting to false.\n  When true, the flag causes supervisor to send the stop signal to the\n  whole process group.  This is useful for programs, such as Flask in debug\n  mode, that do not propagate stop signals to their children, leaving them\n  orphaned.\n\n- Python 2.3 is no longer supported.  The last version that supported Python\n  2.3 is Supervisor 3.0a12.\n\n- Removed the unused \"supervisor_rpc\" entry point from setup.py.\n\n- Fixed a bug in the rotating log handler that would cause unexpected\n  results when two processes were set to log to the same file.  Patch\n  by Whit Morriss.\n\n- Fixed a bug in config file reloading where each reload could leak memory\n  because a list of warning messages would be appended but never cleared.\n  Patch by Philip Zeyliger.\n\n- Added a new Syslog log handler.  Thanks to Denis Bilenko, Nathan L. Smith,\n  and Jason R. Coombs, who each contributed to the patch.\n\n- Put all change history into a single file (CHANGES.txt).\n\n3.0a12 (2011-12-06)\n-------------------\n\n- Released to replace a broken 3.0a11 package where non-Python files were\n  not included in the package.\n\n3.0a11 (2011-12-06)\n-------------------\n\n- Added a new file, ``PLUGINS.rst``, with a listing of third-party plugins\n  for Supervisor.  Contributed by Jens Rantil.\n\n- The ``pid`` command in supervisorctl can now be used to retrieve the PIDs\n  of child processes.  See ``help pid``.  Patch by Gregory Wisniewski.\n\n- Added a new ``host_node_name`` expansion that will be expanded to the\n  value returned by Python's ``platform.node`` (see\n  http://docs.python.org/library/platform.html#platform.node).\n  Patch by Joseph Kondel.\n\n- Fixed a bug in the web interface where pages over 64K would be truncated.\n  Thanks to Drew Perttula and Timothy Jones for reporting this.\n\n- Renamed ``README.txt`` to ``README.rst`` so GitHub renders the file as\n  ReStructuredText.\n\n- The XML-RPC server is now compatible with clients that do not send empty\n  <params> when there are no parameters for the method call.  Thanks to\n  Johannes Becker for reporting this.\n\n- Fixed ``supervisorctl --help`` output to show the correct program name.\n\n- The behavior of the configuration options ``minfds`` and ``minprocs`` has\n  changed.  Previously, if a hard limit was less than ``minfds`` or\n  ``minprocs``, supervisord would unconditionally abort with an error.  Now,\n  supervisord will attempt to raise the hard limit.  This may succeed if\n  supervisord is run as root, otherwise the error is printed as before.\n  Patch by Benoit Sigoure.\n\n- Add a boolean program option ``killasgroup``, defaulting to false,\n  if true when resorting to send SIGKILL to stop/terminate the process\n  send it to its whole process group instead to take care of possible\n  children as well and not leave them behind.  Patch by Samuele Pedroni.\n\n- Environment variables may now be used in the configuration file\n  for options that support string expansion.  Patch by Aleksey Sivokon.\n\n- Fixed a race condition where supervisord might not act on a signal sent\n  to it.  Thanks to Adar Dembo for reporting the issue and supplying the\n  initial patch.\n\n- Updated the output of ``echo_supervisord_conf`` to fix typos and\n  improve comments.  Thanks to Jens Rantil for noticing these.\n\n- Fixed a possible 500 Server Error from the web interface.  This was\n  observed when using Supervisor on a domain socket behind Nginx, where\n  Supervisor would raise an exception because REMOTE_ADDR was not set.\n  Patch by David Bennett.\n\n3.0a10 (2011-03-30)\n-------------------\n\n- Fixed the stylesheet of the web interface so the footer line won't overlap\n  a long process list.  Thanks to Derek DeVries for the patch.\n\n- Allow rpc interface plugins to register new events types.\n\n- Bug fix for FCGI sockets not getting cleaned up when the ``reload`` command\n  is issued from supervisorctl.  Also, the default behavior has changed for\n  FCGI sockets.  They are now closed whenever the number of running processes\n  in a group hits zero.  Previously, the sockets were kept open unless a\n  group-level stop command was issued.\n\n- Better error message when HTTP server cannot reverse-resolve a hostname to\n  an IP address.  Previous behavior: show a socket error.  Current behavior:\n  spit out a suggestion to stdout.\n\n- Environment variables set via ``environment=`` value within\n  ``[supervisord]`` section had no effect.  Thanks to Wyatt Baldwin\n  for a patch.\n\n- Fix bug where stopping process would cause process output that happened\n  after the stop request was issued to be lost.  See\n  https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/11.\n\n- Moved 2.X change log entries into ``HISTORY.txt``.\n\n- Converted ``CHANGES.txt`` and ``README.txt`` into proper ReStructuredText\n  and included them in the ``long_description`` in ``setup.py``.\n\n- Added a tox.ini to the package (run via ``tox`` in the package dir).  Tests\n  supervisor on multiple Python versions.\n\n3.0a9 (2010-08-13)\n------------------\n\n- Use rich comparison methods rather than __cmp__ to sort process configs and\n  process group configs to better straddle Python versions.  (thanks to\n  Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial\n  patch).\n\n- Fixed test_supervisorctl.test_maintail_dashf test for Python 2.7.  (thanks\n  to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem and supplying an initial\n  patch).\n\n- Fixed the way that supervisor.datatypes.url computes a \"good\" URL\n  for compatibility with Python 2.7 and Python >= 2.6.5.  URLs with\n  bogus \"schemes://\" will now be accepted as a version-straddling\n  compromise (before they were rejected before supervisor would\n  start).  (thanks to Jonathan Riboux for identifying the problem\n  and supplying an initial patch).\n\n- Add a ``-v`` / ``--version`` option to supervisord: Print the\n  supervisord version number out to stdout and exit.  (Roger Hoover)\n\n- Import iterparse from xml.etree when available (eg: Python 2.6).  Patch\n  by Sidnei da Silva.\n\n- Fixed the url to the supervisor-users mailing list.  Patch by\n  Sidnei da Silva\n\n- When parsing \"environment=\" in the config file, changes introduced in\n  3.0a8 prevented Supervisor from parsing some characters commonly\n  found in paths unless quoting was used as in this example::\n\n    environment=HOME='/home/auser'\n\n  Supervisor once again allows the above line to be written as::\n\n    environment=HOME=/home/auser\n\n  Alphanumeric characters, \"_\", \"/\", \".\", \"+\", \"-\", \"(\", \")\", and \":\" can all\n  be used as a value without quoting. If any other characters are needed in\n  the value, please quote it as in the first example above.  Thanks to Paul\n  Heideman for reporting this issue.\n\n- Supervisor will now look for its config file in locations relative to the\n  executable path, allowing it to be used more easily in virtual\n  environments.  If sys.argv[0] is ``/path/to/venv/bin/supervisorctl``,\n  supervisor will now look for it's config file in\n  ``/path/to/venv/etc/supervisord.conf`` and\n  ``/path/to/venv/supervisord.conf`` in addition to the other standard\n  locations.  Patch by Chris Rossi.\n\n3.0a8 (2010-01-20)\n------------------\n\n- Don't cleanup file descriptors on first supervisord invocation:\n  this is a lame workaround for Snow Leopard systems that use\n  libdispatch and are receiving \"Illegal instruction\" messages at\n  supervisord startup time.  Restarting supervisord via\n  \"supervisorctl restart\" may still cause a crash on these systems.\n\n- Got rid of Medusa hashbang headers in various files to ease RPM\n  packaging.\n\n- Allow umask to be 000 (patch contributed by Rowan Nairn).\n\n- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where supervisorctl wouldn't ask\n  for a username/password combination properly from a\n  password-protected supervisord if it wasn't filled in within the\n  \"[supervisorctl]\" section username/password values.  It now\n  properly asks for a username and password.\n\n- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where setup.py would not detect the\n  Python version correctly.  Patch by Daniele Paolella.\n\n- Fixed a bug introduced in 3.0a7 where parsing a string of key/value\n  pairs failed on Python 2.3 due to use of regular expression syntax\n  introduced in Python 2.4.\n\n- Removed the test suite for the ``memmon`` console script, which was\n  moved to the Superlance package in 3.0a7.\n\n- Added release dates to CHANGES.txt.\n\n- Reloading the config for an fcgi process group did not close the fcgi\n  socket - now, the socket is closed whenever the group is stopped as a unit\n  (including during config update). However, if you stop all the processes\n  in a group individually, the socket will remain open to allow for graceful\n  restarts of FCGI daemons.  (Roger Hoover)\n\n- Rereading the config did not pick up changes to the socket parameter in a\n  fcgi-program section.  (Roger Hoover)\n\n- Made a more friendly exception message when a FCGI socket cannot be\n  created.  (Roger Hoover)\n\n- Fixed a bug where the --serverurl option of supervisorctl would not\n  accept a URL with a \"unix\" scheme.  (Jason Kirtland)\n\n- Running the tests now requires the \"mock\" package.  This dependency has\n  been added to \"tests_require\" in setup.py.  (Roger Hoover)\n\n- Added support for setting the ownership and permissions for an FCGI socket.\n  This is done using new \"socket_owner\" and \"socket_mode\" options in an\n  [fcgi-program:x] section.  See the manual for details.  (Roger Hoover)\n\n- Fixed a bug where the FCGI socket reference count was not getting\n  decremented on spawn error.  (Roger Hoover)\n\n- Fixed a Python 2.6 deprecation warning on use of the \"sha\" module.\n\n- Updated ez_setup.py to one that knows about setuptools 0.6c11.\n\n- Running \"supervisorctl shutdown\" no longer dumps a Python backtrace\n  when it can't connect to supervisord on the expected socket.  Thanks\n  to Benjamin Smith for reporting this.\n\n- Removed use of collections.deque in our bundled version of asynchat\n  because it broke compatibility with Python 2.3.\n\n- The sample configuration output by \"echo_supervisord_conf\" now correctly\n  shows the default for \"autorestart\" as \"unexpected\".  Thanks to\n  William Dode for noticing it showed the wrong value.\n\n3.0a7 (2009-05-24)\n------------------\n\n- We now bundle our own patched version of Medusa contributed by Jason\n  Kirtland to allow Supervisor to run on Python 2.6.  This was done\n  because Python 2.6 introduced backwards incompatible changes to\n  asyncore and asynchat in the stdlib.\n\n- The console script ``memmon``, introduced in Supervisor 3.0a4, has\n  been moved to Superlance (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/superlance).\n  The Superlance package contains other useful monitoring tools designed\n  to run under Supervisor.\n\n- Supervisorctl now correctly interprets all of the error codes that can\n  be returned when starting a process.  Patch by Francesc Alted.\n\n- New ``stdout_events_enabled`` and ``stderr_events_enabled`` config options\n  have been added to the ``[program:x]``, ``[fcgi-program:x]``, and\n  ``[eventlistener:x]`` sections.  These enable the emitting of new\n  PROCESS_LOG events for a program.  If unspecified, the default is False.\n\n  If enabled for a subprocess, and data is received from the stdout or\n  stderr of the subprocess while not in the special capture mode used by\n  PROCESS_COMMUNICATION, an event will be emitted.\n\n  Event listeners can subscribe to either PROCESS_LOG_STDOUT or\n  PROCESS_LOG_STDERR individually, or PROCESS_LOG for both.\n\n- Values for subprocess environment variables specified with environment=\n  in supervisord.conf can now be optionally quoted, allowing them to\n  contain commas.  Patch by Tim Godfrey.\n\n- Added a new event type, REMOTE_COMMUNICATION, that is emitted by a new\n  RPC method, supervisor.sendRemoteCommEvent().\n\n- Patch for bug #268 (KeyError on ``here`` expansion for\n  stdout/stderr_logfile) from David E. Kindred.\n\n- Add ``reread``, ``update``, and ``avail`` commands based on Anders\n  Quist's ``online_config_reload.diff`` patch.  This patch extends\n  the \"add\" and \"drop\" commands with automagical behavior::\n\n    In supervisorctl:\n\n      supervisor> status\n      bar                              RUNNING    pid 14864, uptime 18:03:42\n      baz                              RUNNING    pid 23260, uptime 0:10:16\n      foo                              RUNNING    pid 14866, uptime 18:03:42\n      gazonk                           RUNNING    pid 23261, uptime 0:10:16\n      supervisor> avail\n      bar                              in use    auto      999:999\n      baz                              in use    auto      999:999\n      foo                              in use    auto      999:999\n      gazonk                           in use    auto      999:999\n      quux                             avail     auto      999:999\n\n    Now we add this to our conf:\n\n      [group:zegroup]\n      programs=baz,gazonk\n\n    Then we reread conf:\n\n      supervisor> reread\n      baz: disappeared\n      gazonk: disappeared\n      quux: available\n      zegroup: available\n      supervisor> avail\n      bar                              in use    auto      999:999\n      foo                              in use    auto      999:999\n      quux                             avail     auto      999:999\n      zegroup:baz                      avail     auto      999:999\n      zegroup:gazonk                   avail     auto      999:999\n      supervisor> status\n      bar                              RUNNING    pid 14864, uptime 18:04:18\n      baz                              RUNNING    pid 23260, uptime 0:10:52\n      foo                              RUNNING    pid 14866, uptime 18:04:18\n      gazonk                           RUNNING    pid 23261, uptime 0:10:52\n\n    The magic make-it-so command:\n\n      supervisor> update\n      baz: stopped\n      baz: removed process group\n      gazonk: stopped\n      gazonk: removed process group\n      zegroup: added process group\n      quux: added process group\n      supervisor> status\n      bar                              RUNNING    pid 14864, uptime 18:04:43\n      foo                              RUNNING    pid 14866, uptime 18:04:43\n      quux                             RUNNING    pid 23561, uptime 0:00:02\n      zegroup:baz                      RUNNING    pid 23559, uptime 0:00:02\n      zegroup:gazonk                   RUNNING    pid 23560, uptime 0:00:02\n      supervisor> avail\n      bar                              in use    auto      999:999\n      foo                              in use    auto      999:999\n      quux                             in use    auto      999:999\n      zegroup:baz                      in use    auto      999:999\n      zegroup:gazonk                   in use    auto      999:999\n\n- Fix bug with symptom \"KeyError: 'process_name'\" when using a logfile name\n  including documented``process_name`` Python string expansions.\n\n- Tab completions in the supervisorctl shell, and a foreground mode for\n  Supervisor, implemented as a part of GSoC.  The supervisorctl program now\n  has a ``fg`` command, which makes it possible to supply inputs to a\n  process, and see its output/error stream in real time.\n\n- Process config reloading implemented by Anders Quist.  The\n  supervisorctl program now has the commands \"add\" and \"drop\".\n  \"add <programname>\" adds the process group implied by <programname>\n  in the config file.  \"drop <programname>\" removes the process\n  group from the running configuration (it must already be stopped).\n  This makes it possible to add processes to and remove processes from\n  a running supervisord without restarting the supervisord process.\n\n- Fixed a bug where opening the HTTP servers would fail silently\n  for socket errors other than errno.EADDRINUSE.\n\n- Thanks to Dave Peticolas, using \"reload\" against a supervisord\n  that is running in the background no longer causes supervisord\n  to crash.\n\n- Configuration options for logfiles now accept mixed case reserved\n  words (e.g. \"AUTO\" or \"auto\") for consistency with other options.\n\n- childutils.eventdata was buggy, it could not deal with carriage returns\n  in data.  See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/257.  Thanks\n  to Ian Bicking.\n\n- Per-process exitcodes= configuration now will not accept exit\n  codes that are not 8-bit unsigned integers (supervisord will not\n  start when one of the exit codes is outside the range of 0 - 255).\n\n- Per-process ``directory`` value can now contain expandable values like\n  ``%(here)s``. (See http://www.plope.com/software/collector/262).\n\n- Accepted patch from Roger Hoover to allow for a new sort of\n  process group: \"fcgi-program\".  Adding one of these to your\n  supervisord.conf allows you to control fastcgi programs.  FastCGI\n  programs cannot belong to heterogenous groups.\n\n  The configuration for FastCGI programs is the same as regular programs\n  except an additional \"socket\" parameter.  Substitution happens on the\n  socket parameter with the ``here`` and ``program_name`` variables::\n\n   [fcgi-program:fcgi_test]\n   ;socket=tcp://localhost:8002\n   socket=unix:///path/to/fcgi/socket\n\n- Supervisorctl now supports a plugin model for supervisorctl\n  commands.\n\n- Added the ability to retrieve supervisord's own pid through\n  supervisor.getPID() on the XML-RPC interface or a new\n  \"pid\" command on supervisorctl.\n\n3.0a6 (2008-04-07)\n------------------\n\n- The RotatingFileLogger had a race condition in its doRollover\n  method whereby a file might not actually exist despite a call to\n  os.path.exists on the line above a place where we try to remove\n  it.  We catch the exception now and ignore the missing file.\n\n3.0a5 (2008-03-13)\n------------------\n\n- Supervisorctl now supports persistent readline history.  To\n  enable, add \"history_file = <pathname>\" to the ``[supervisorctl]``\n  section in your supervisord.conf file.\n\n- Multiple commands may now be issued on one supervisorctl command\n  line, e.g. \"restart prog; tail -f prog\".  Separate commands with a\n  single semicolon; they will be executed in order as you would\n  expect.\n\n3.0a4 (2008-01-30)\n------------------\n\n- 3.0a3 broke Python 2.3 backwards compatibility.\n\n- On Debian Sarge, one user reported that a call to\n  options.mktempfile would fail with an \"[Errno 9] Bad file\n  descriptor\" at supervisord startup time.  I was unable to\n  reproduce this, but we found a workaround that seemed to work for\n  him and it's included in this release.  See\n  http://www.plope.com/software/collector/252 for more information.\n  Thanks to William Dode.\n\n- The fault ``ALREADY_TERMINATED`` has been removed.  It was only raised by\n  supervisor.sendProcessStdin().  That method now returns ``NOT_RUNNING``\n  for parity with the other methods. (Mike Naberezny)\n\n- The fault TIMED_OUT has been removed.  It was not used.\n\n- Supervisor now depends on meld3 0.6.4, which does not compile its\n  C extensions by default, so there is no more need to faff around\n  with NO_MELD3_EXTENSION_MODULES during installation if you don't\n  have a C compiler or the Python development libraries on your\n  system.\n\n- Instead of making a user root around for the sample.conf file,\n  provide a convenience command \"echo_supervisord_conf\", which he can\n  use to echo the sample.conf to his terminal (and redirect to a file\n  appropriately).  This is a new user convenience (especially one who\n  has no Python experience).\n\n- Added ``numprocs_start`` config option to ``[program:x]`` and\n  ``[eventlistener:x]`` sections.  This is an offset used to compute\n  the first integer that ``numprocs`` will begin to start from.\n  Contributed by Antonio Beamud Montero.\n\n- Added capability for ``[include]`` config section to config format.\n  This section must contain a single key \"files\", which must name a\n  space-separated list of file globs that will be included in\n  supervisor's configuration.  Contributed by Ian Bicking.\n\n- Invoking the ``reload`` supervisorctl command could trigger a bug in\n  supervisord which caused it to crash.  See\n  http://www.plope.com/software/collector/253 .  Thanks to William Dode for\n  a bug report.\n\n- The ``pidproxy`` script was made into a console script.\n\n- The ``password`` value in both the ``[inet_http_server]`` and\n  ``[unix_http_server]`` sections can now optionally be specified as a SHA\n  hexdigest instead of as cleartext.  Values prefixed with ``{SHA}`` will be\n  considered SHA hex digests.  To encrypt a password to a form suitable for\n  pasting into the configuration file using Python, do, e.g.::\n\n     >>> import sha\n     >>> '{SHA}' + sha.new('thepassword').hexdigest()\n     '{SHA}82ab876d1387bfafe46cc1c8a2ef074eae50cb1d'\n\n- The subtypes of the events PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE (and\n  PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE itself) have been removed, replaced with a\n  simpler set of PROCESS_STATE subscribable event types.\n\n  The new event types are:\n\n    PROCESS_STATE_STOPPED\n    PROCESS_STATE_EXITED\n    PROCESS_STATE_STARTING\n    PROCESS_STATE_STOPPING\n    PROCESS_STATE_BACKOFF\n    PROCESS_STATE_FATAL\n    PROCESS_STATE_RUNNING\n    PROCESS_STATE_UNKNOWN\n    PROCESS_STATE # abstract\n\n  PROCESS_STATE_STARTING replaces:\n\n    PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE_STARTING_FROM_STOPPED\n    PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE_STARTING_FROM_BACKOFF\n    PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE_STARTING_FROM_EXITED\n    PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE_STARTING_FROM_FATAL\n\n  PROCESS_STATE_RUNNING replaces\n  PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE_RUNNING_FROM_STARTED\n\n  PROCESS_STATE_BACKOFF replaces\n  PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE_BACKOFF_FROM_STARTING\n\n  PROCESS_STATE_STOPPING replaces:\n\n    PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE_STOPPING_FROM_RUNNING\n    PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE_STOPPING_FROM_STARTING\n\n  PROCESS_STATE_EXITED replaces\n  PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE_EXITED_FROM_RUNNING\n\n  PROCESS_STATE_STOPPED replaces\n  PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE_STOPPED_FROM_STOPPING\n\n  PROCESS_STATE_FATAL replaces\n  PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE_FATAL_FROM_BACKOFF\n\n  PROCESS_STATE_UNKNOWN replaces PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE_TO_UNKNOWN\n\n  PROCESS_STATE replaces PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE\n\n  The PROCESS_STATE_CHANGE_EXITED_OR_STOPPED abstract event is gone.\n\n  All process state changes have at least \"processname\",\n  \"groupname\", and \"from_state\" (the name of the previous state) in\n  their serializations.\n\n  PROCESS_STATE_EXITED additionally has \"expected\" (1 or 0) and \"pid\"\n  (the process id) in its serialization.\n\n  PROCESS_STATE_RUNNING, PROCESS_STATE_STOPPING,\n  PROCESS_STATE_STOPPED additionally have \"pid\" in their\n  serializations.\n\n  PROCESS_STATE_STARTING and PROCESS_STATE_BACKOFF have \"tries\" in\n  their serialization (initially \"0\", bumped +1 each time a start\n  retry happens).\n\n- Remove documentation from README.txt, point people to\n  http://supervisord.org/manual/ .\n\n- The eventlistener request/response protocol has changed.  OK/FAIL\n  must now be wrapped in a RESULT envelope so we can use it for more\n  specialized communications.\n\n  Previously, to signify success, an event listener would write the string\n  ``OK\\n`` to its stdout.  To signify that the event was seen but couldn't\n  be handled by the listener and should be rebuffered, an event listener\n  would write the string ``FAIL\\n`` to its stdout.\n\n  In the new protocol, the listener must write the string::\n\n    RESULT {resultlen}\\n{result}\n\n  For example, to signify OK::\n\n    RESULT 2\\nOK\n\n  To signify FAIL::\n\n    RESULT 4\\nFAIL\n\n  See the scripts/sample_eventlistener.py script for an example.\n\n- To provide a hook point for custom results returned from event\n  handlers (see above) the [eventlistener:x] configuration sections\n  now accept a \"result_handler=\" parameter,\n  e.g. \"result_handler=supervisor.dispatchers:default_handler\" (the\n  default) or \"handler=mypackage:myhandler\".  The keys are pkgutil\n  \"entry point\" specifications (importable Python function names).\n  Result handlers must be callables which accept two arguments: one\n  named \"event\" which represents the event, and the other named\n  \"result\", which represents the listener's result.  A result\n  handler either executes successfully or raises an exception.  If\n  it raises a supervisor.dispatchers.RejectEvent exception, the\n  event will be rebuffered, and the eventhandler will be placed back\n  into the ACKNOWLEDGED state.  If it raises any other exception,\n  the event handler will be placed in the UNKNOWN state.  If it does\n  not raise any exception, the event is considered successfully\n  processed.  A result handler's return value is ignored.  Writing a\n  result handler is a \"in case of emergency break glass\" sort of\n  thing, it is not something to be used for arbitrary business code.\n  In particular, handlers *must not block* for any appreciable\n  amount of time.\n\n  The standard eventlistener result handler\n  (supervisor.dispatchers:default_handler) does nothing if it receives an\n  \"OK\" and will raise a supervisor.dispatchers.RejectEvent exception if it\n  receives any other value.\n\n- Supervisord now emits TICK events, which happen every N seconds.\n  Three types of TICK events are available: TICK_5 (every five\n  seconds), TICK_60 (every minute), TICK_3600 (every hour).  Event\n  listeners may subscribe to one of these types of events to perform\n  every-so-often processing.  TICK events are subtypes of the EVENT\n  type.\n\n- Get rid of OSX platform-specific memory monitor and replace with\n  memmon.py, which works on both Linux and Mac OS.  This script is\n  now a console script named \"memmon\".\n\n- Allow \"web handler\" (the handler which receives http requests from\n  browsers visiting the web UI of supervisor) to deal with POST requests.\n\n- RPC interface methods stopProcess(), stopProcessGroup(), and\n  stopAllProcesses() now take an optional \"wait\" argument that defaults\n  to True for parity with the start methods.\n\n3.0a3 (2007-10-02)\n------------------\n\n- Supervisorctl now reports a better error message when the main supervisor\n  XML-RPC namespace is not registered.  Thanks to Mike Orr for reporting\n  this. (Mike Naberezny)\n\n- Create ``scripts`` directory within supervisor package, move\n  ``pidproxy.py`` there, and place sample event listener and comm event\n  programs within the directory.\n\n- When an event notification is buffered (either because a listener rejected\n  it or because all listeners were busy when we attempted to send it\n  originally), we now rebuffer it in a way that will result in it being\n  retried earlier than it used to be.\n\n- When a listener process exits (unexpectedly) before transitioning from the\n  BUSY state, rebuffer the event that was being processed.\n\n- supervisorctl ``tail`` command now accepts a trailing specifier: ``stderr``\n  or ``stdout``, which respectively, allow a user to tail the stderr or\n  stdout of the named process.  When this specifier is not provided, tail\n  defaults to stdout.\n\n- supervisor ``clear`` command now clears both stderr and stdout logs for the\n  given process.\n\n- When a process encounters a spawn error as a result of a failed execve or\n  when it cannot setuid to a given uid, it now puts this info into the\n  process' stderr log rather than its stdout log.\n\n- The event listener protocol header now contains the ``server`` identifier,\n  the ``pool`` that the event emanated from, and the ``poolserial`` as well\n  as the values it previously contained (version, event name, serial, and\n  length).  The server identifier is taken from the config file options value\n  ``identifier``, the ``pool`` value is the name of the listener pool that\n  this event emanates from, and the ``poolserial`` is a serial number\n  assigned to the event local to the pool that is processing it.\n\n- The event listener protocol header is now a sequence of key-value\n  pairs rather than a list of positional values.  Previously, a\n  representative header looked like::\n\n    SUPERVISOR3.0 PROCESS_COMMUNICATION_STDOUT 30 22\\n\n\n  Now it looks like::\n\n    ver:3.0 server:supervisor serial:21 ...\n\n- Specific event payload serializations have changed.  All event\n  types that deal with processes now include the pid of the process\n  that the event is describing.  In event serialization \"header\"\n  values, we've removed the space between the header name and the\n  value and headers are now separated by a space instead of a line\n  feed.  The names of keys in all event types have had underscores\n  removed.\n\n- Abandon the use of the Python stdlib ``logging`` module for speed\n  and cleanliness purposes.  We've rolled our own.\n\n- Fix crash on start if AUTO logging is used with a max_bytes of\n  zero for a process.\n\n- Improve process communication event performance.\n\n- The process config parameters ``stdout_capturefile`` and\n  ``stderr_capturefile`` are no longer valid.  They have been replaced with\n  the ``stdout_capture_maxbytes`` and ``stderr_capture_maxbytes`` parameters,\n  which are meant to be suffix-multiplied integers.  They both default to\n  zero.  When they are zero, process communication event capturing is not\n  performed.  When either is nonzero, the value represents the maximum number\n  of bytes that will be captured between process event start and end tags.\n  This change was to support the fact that we no longer keep capture data in\n  a separate file, we just use a FIFO in RAM to maintain capture info.  For\n  users whom don't care about process communication events, or whom haven't\n  changed the defaults for ``stdout_capturefile`` or ``stderr_capturefile``,\n  they needn't do anything to their configurations to deal with this change.\n\n- Log message levels have been normalized.  In particular, process\n  stdin/stdout is now logged at ``debug`` level rather than at ``trace``\n  level (``trace`` level is now reserved for output useful typically for\n  debugging supervisor itself).  See \"Supervisor Log Levels\" in the\n  documentation for more info.\n\n- When an event is rebuffered (because all listeners are busy or a\n  listener rejected the event), the rebuffered event is now inserted\n  in the head of the listener event queue.  This doesn't guarantee\n  event emission in natural ordering, because if a listener rejects\n  an event or dies while it's processing an event, it can take an\n  arbitrary amount of time for the event to be rebuffered, and other\n  events may be processed in the meantime.  But if pool listeners\n  never reject an event or don't die while processing an event, this\n  guarantees that events will be emitted in the order that they were\n  received because if all listeners are busy, the rebuffered event\n  will be tried again \"first\" on the next go-around.\n\n- Removed EVENT_BUFFER_OVERFLOW event type.\n\n- The supervisorctl xmlrpc proxy can now communicate with\n  supervisord using a persistent HTTP connection.\n\n- A new module \"supervisor.childutils\" was added.  This module\n  provides utilities for Python scripts which act as children of\n  supervisord.  Most notably, it contains an API method\n  \"getRPCInterface\" allows you to obtain an xmlrpclib ServerProxy\n  that is willing to communicate with the parent supervisor.  It\n  also contains utility functions that allow for parsing of\n  supervisor event listener protocol headers.  A pair of scripts\n  (loop_eventgen.py and loop_listener.py) were added to the script\n  directory that serve as examples about how to use the childutils\n  module.\n\n- A new envvar is added to child process environments:\n  SUPERVISOR_SERVER_URL.  This contains the server URL for the\n  supervisord running the child.\n\n- An ``OK`` URL was added at ``/ok.html`` which just returns the string\n  ``OK`` (can be used for up checks or speed checks via plain-old-HTTP).\n\n- An additional command-line option ``--profile_options`` is accepted\n  by the supervisord script for developer use::\n\n    supervisord -n -c sample.conf --profile_options=cumulative,calls\n\n  The values are sort_stats options that can be passed to the\n  standard Python profiler's PStats sort_stats method.\n\n  When you exit supervisor, it will print Python profiling output to\n  stdout.\n\n- If cElementTree is installed in the Python used to invoke\n  supervisor, an alternate (faster, by about 2X) XML parser will be\n  used to parse XML-RPC request bodies.  cElementTree was added as\n  an \"extras_require\" option in setup.py.\n\n- Added the ability to start, stop, and restart process groups to\n  supervisorctl.  To start a group, use ``start groupname:*``.  To start\n  multiple groups, use ``start groupname1:* groupname2:*``.  Equivalent\n  commands work for \"stop\" and \"restart\". You can mix and match short\n  processnames, fully-specified group:process names, and groupsplats on the\n  same line for any of these commands.\n\n- Added ``directory`` option to process config.  If you set this\n  option, supervisor will chdir to this directory before executing\n  the child program (and thus it will be the child's cwd).\n\n- Added ``umask`` option to process config.  If you set this option,\n  supervisor will set the umask of the child program.  (Thanks to\n  Ian Bicking for the suggestion).\n\n- A pair of scripts ``osx_memmon_eventgen.py`` and `osx_memmon_listener.py``\n  have been added to the scripts directory.  If they are used together as\n  described in their comments, processes which are consuming \"too much\"\n  memory will be restarted.  The ``eventgen`` script only works on OSX (my\n  main development platform) but it should be trivially generalizable to\n  other operating systems.\n\n- The long form ``--configuration`` (-c) command line option for\n  supervisord was broken.  Reported by Mike Orr.  (Mike Naberezny)\n\n- New log level: BLAT (blather).  We log all\n  supervisor-internal-related debugging info here.  Thanks to Mike\n  Orr for the suggestion.\n\n- We now allow supervisor to listen on both a UNIX domain socket and an inet\n  socket instead of making them mutually exclusive.  As a result, the options\n  \"http_port\", \"http_username\", \"http_password\", \"sockchmod\" and \"sockchown\"\n  are no longer part of the ``[supervisord]`` section configuration. These\n  have been supplanted by two other sections: ``[unix_http_server]`` and\n  ``[inet_http_server]``.  You'll need to insert one or the other (depending\n  on whether you want to listen on a UNIX domain socket or a TCP socket\n  respectively) or both into your supervisord.conf file.  These sections have\n  their own options (where applicable) for port, username, password, chmod,\n  and chown.  See README.txt for more information about these sections.\n\n- All supervisord command-line options related to \"http_port\",\n  \"http_username\", \"http_password\", \"sockchmod\" and \"sockchown\" have\n  been removed (see above point for rationale).\n\n- The option that *used* to be ``sockchown`` within the ``[supervisord]``\n  section (and is now named ``chown`` within the ``[unix_http_server]``\n  section) used to accept a dot-separated user.group value.  The separator\n  now must be a colon \":\", e.g. \"user:group\".  Unices allow for dots in\n  usernames, so this change is a bugfix.  Thanks to Ian Bicking for the bug\n  report.\n\n- If a '-c' option is not specified on the command line, both supervisord and\n  supervisorctl will search for one in the paths ``./supervisord.conf`` ,\n  ``./etc/supervisord.conf`` (relative to the current working dir when\n  supervisord or supervisorctl is invoked) or in ``/etc/supervisord.conf``\n  (the old default path).  These paths are searched in order, and supervisord\n  and supervisorctl will use the first one found.  If none are found,\n  supervisor will fail to start.\n\n- The Python string expression ``%(here)s`` (referring to the directory in\n  which the configuration file was found) can be used within the\n  following sections/options within the config file::\n\n      unix_http_server:file\n      supervisor:directory\n      supervisor:logfile\n      supervisor:pidfile\n      supervisor:childlogdir\n      supervisor:environment\n      program:environment\n      program:stdout_logfile\n      program:stderr_logfile\n      program:process_name\n      program:command\n\n- The ``--environment`` aka ``-b`` option was removed from the list of\n  available command-line switches to supervisord (use \"A=1 B=2\n  bin/supervisord\" instead).\n\n- If the socket filename (the tail-end of the unix:// URL) was\n  longer than 64 characters, supervisorctl would fail with an\n  encoding error at startup.\n\n- The ``identifier`` command-line argument was not functional.\n\n- Fixed http://www.plope.com/software/collector/215 (bad error\n  message in supervisorctl when program command not found on PATH).\n\n- Some child processes may not have been shut down properly at\n  supervisor shutdown time.\n\n- Move to ZPL-derived (but not ZPL) license available from\n  http://www.repoze.org/LICENSE.txt; it's slightly less restrictive\n  than the ZPL (no servicemark clause).\n\n- Spurious errors related to unclosed files (\"bad file descriptor\",\n  typically) were evident at supervisord \"reload\" time (when using\n  the \"reload\" command from supervisorctl).\n\n- We no longer bundle ez_setup to bootstrap setuptools installation.\n\n3.0a2 (2007-08-24)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed the README.txt example for defining the supervisor RPC\n  interface in the configuration file.  Thanks to Drew Perttula.\n\n- Fixed a bug where process communication events would not have the\n  proper payload if the payload data was very short.\n\n- when supervisord attempted to kill a process with SIGKILL after\n  the process was not killed within \"stopwaitsecs\" using a \"normal\"\n  kill signal, supervisord would crash with an improper\n  AssertionError.  Thanks to Calvin Hendryx-Parker.\n\n- On Linux, Supervisor would consume too much CPU in an effective\n  \"busywait\" between the time a subprocess exited and the time at\n  which supervisor was notified of its exit status.  Thanks to Drew\n  Perttula.\n\n- RPC interface behavior change: if the RPC method\n  \"sendProcessStdin\" is called against a process that has closed its\n  stdin file descriptor (e.g. it has done the equivalent of\n  \"sys.stdin.close(); os.close(0)\"), we return a NO_FILE fault\n  instead of accepting the data.\n\n- Changed the semantics of the process configuration ``autorestart``\n  parameter with respect to processes which move between the RUNNING and\n  EXITED state.  ``autorestart`` was previously a boolean.  Now it's a\n  trinary, accepting one of ``false``, ``unexpected``, or ``true``.  If it's\n  ``false``, a process will never be automatically restarted from the EXITED\n  state.  If it's ``unexpected``, a process that enters the EXITED state will\n  be automatically restarted if it exited with an exit code that was not\n  named in the process config's ``exitcodes`` list.  If it's ``true``, a\n  process that enters the EXITED state will be automatically restarted\n  unconditionally.  The default is now ``unexpected`` (it was previously\n  ``true``).  The readdition of this feature is a reversion of the behavior\n  change note in the changelog notes for 3.0a1 that asserted we never cared\n  about the process' exit status when determining whether to restart it or\n  not.\n\n- setup.py develop (and presumably setup.py install) would fail under Python\n  2.3.3, because setuptools attempted to import ``splituser`` from urllib2,\n  and it didn't exist.\n\n- It's now possible to use ``setup.py install`` and ``setup.py develop`` on\n  systems which do not have a C compiler if you set the environment variable\n  \"NO_MELD3_EXTENSION_MODULES=1\" in the shell in which you invoke these\n  commands (versions of meld3 > 0.6.1 respect this envvar and do not try to\n  compile optional C extensions when it's set).\n\n- The test suite would fail on Python versions <= 2.3.3 because\n  the \"assertTrue\" and \"assertFalse\" methods of unittest.TestCase\n  didn't exist in those versions.\n\n- The ``supervisorctl`` and ``supervisord`` wrapper scripts were disused in\n  favor of using setuptools' ``console_scripts`` entry point settings.\n\n- Documentation files and the sample configuration file are put into\n  the generated supervisor egg's ``doc`` directory.\n\n- Using the web interface would cause fairly dramatic memory\n  leakage.  We now require a version of meld3 that does not appear\n  to leak memory from its C extensions (0.6.3).\n\n3.0a1 (2007-08-16)\n------------------\n\n- Default config file comment documented 10 secs as default for ``startsecs``\n  value in process config, in reality it was 1 sec.  Thanks to Christoph\n  Zwerschke.\n\n- Make note of subprocess environment behavior in README.txt.\n  Thanks to Christoph Zwerschke.\n\n- New \"strip_ansi\" config file option attempts to strip ANSI escape\n  sequences from logs for smaller/more readable logs (submitted by\n  Mike Naberezny).\n\n- The XML-RPC method supervisor.getVersion() has been renamed for\n  clarity to supervisor.getAPIVersion().  The old name is aliased\n  for compatibility but is deprecated and will be removed in a\n  future version (Mike Naberezny).\n\n- Improved web interface styling (Mike Naberezny, Derek DeVries)\n\n- The XML-RPC method supervisor.startProcess() now checks that\n  the file exists and is executable (Mike Naberezny).\n\n- Two environment variables, \"SUPERVISOR_PROCESS_NAME\" and\n  \"SUPERVISOR_PROCESS_GROUP\" are set in the environment of child\n  processes, representing the name of the process and group in\n  supervisor's configuration.\n\n- Process state map change: a process may now move directly from the\n  STARTING state to the STOPPING state (as a result of a stop\n  request).\n\n- Behavior change: if ``autorestart`` is true, even if a process exits with\n  an \"expected\" exit code, it will still be restarted.  In the immediately\n  prior release of supervisor, this was true anyway, and no one complained,\n  so we're going to consider that the \"officially correct\" behavior from now\n  on.\n\n- Supervisor now logs subprocess stdout and stderr independently.\n  The old program config keys \"logfile\", \"logfile_backups\" and\n  \"logfile_maxbytes\" are superseded by \"stdout_logfile\",\n  \"stdout_logfile_backups\", and \"stdout_logfile_maxbytes\".  Added\n  keys include \"stderr_logfile\", \"stderr_logfile_backups\", and\n  \"stderr_logfile_maxbytes\".  An additional \"redirect_stderr\" key is\n  used to cause program stderr output to be sent to its stdout\n  channel.  The keys \"log_stderr\" and \"log_stdout\" have been\n  removed.\n\n- ``[program:x]`` config file sections now represent \"homogeneous process\n  groups\" instead of single processes.  A \"numprocs\" key in the section\n  represents the number of processes that are in the group.  A \"process_name\"\n  key in the section allows composition of the each process' name within the\n  homogeneous group.\n\n- A new kind of config file section, ``[group:x]`` now exists, allowing users\n  to group heterogeneous processes together into a process group that can be\n  controlled as a unit from a client.\n\n- Supervisord now emits \"events\" at certain points in its normal\n  operation.  These events include supervisor state change events,\n  process state change events, and \"process communication events\".\n\n- A new kind of config file section ``[eventlistener:x]`` now exists.  Each\n  section represents an \"event listener pool\", which is a special kind of\n  homogeneous process group.  Each process in the pool is meant to receive\n  supervisor \"events\" via its stdin and perform some notification (e.g. send\n  a mail, log, make an http request, etc.)\n\n- Supervisord can now capture data between special tokens in\n  subprocess stdout/stderr output and emit a \"process communications\n  event\" as a result.\n\n- Supervisor's XML-RPC interface may be extended arbitrarily by programmers.\n  Additional top-level namespace XML-RPC interfaces can be added using the\n  ``[rpcinterface:foo]`` declaration in the configuration file.\n\n- New ``supervisor``-namespace XML-RPC methods have been added:\n  getAPIVersion (returns the XML-RPC API version, the older\n  \"getVersion\" is now deprecated), \"startProcessGroup\" (starts all\n  processes in a supervisor process group), \"stopProcessGroup\"\n  (stops all processes in a supervisor process group), and\n  \"sendProcessStdin\" (sends data to a process' stdin file\n  descriptor).\n\n- ``supervisor``-namespace XML-RPC methods which previously accepted\n  ony a process name as \"name\" (startProcess, stopProcess,\n  getProcessInfo, readProcessLog, tailProcessLog, and\n  clearProcessLog) now accept a \"name\" which may contain both the\n  process name and the process group name in the form\n  ``groupname:procname``.  For backwards compatibility purposes,\n  \"simple\" names will also be accepted but will be expanded\n  internally (e.g. if \"foo\" is sent as a name, it will be expanded\n  to \"foo:foo\", representing the foo process within the foo process\n  group).\n\n- 2.X versions of supervisorctl will work against supervisor 3.0\n  servers in a degraded fashion, but 3.X versions of supervisorctl\n  will not work at all against supervisor 2.X servers.\n\n2.2b1 (2007-03-31)\n------------------\n\n- Individual program configuration sections can now specify an\n  environment.\n\n- Added a 'version' command to supervisorctl.  This returns the\n  version of the supervisor2 package which the remote supervisord\n  process is using.\n\n2.1 (2007-03-17)\n----------------\n\n- When supervisord was invoked more than once, and its configuration\n  was set up to use a UNIX domain socket as the HTTP server, the\n  socket file would be erased in error.  The symptom of this was\n  that a subsequent invocation of supervisorctl could not find the\n  socket file, so the process could not be controlled (it and all of\n  its subprocesses would need to be killed by hand).\n\n- Close subprocess file descriptors properly when a subprocess exits\n  or otherwise dies.  This should result in fewer \"too many open\n  files to spawn foo\" messages when supervisor is left up for long\n  periods of time.\n\n- When a process was not killable with a \"normal\" signal at shutdown\n  time, too many \"INFO: waiting for x to die\" messages would be sent\n  to the log until we ended up killing the process with a SIGKILL.\n  Now a maximum of one every three seconds is sent up until SIGKILL\n  time.  Thanks to Ian Bicking.\n\n- Add an assertion: we never want to try to marshal None to XML-RPC\n  callers.  Issue 223 in the collector from vgatto indicates that\n  somehow a supervisor XML-RPC method is returning None (which\n  should never happen), but I cannot identify how.  Maybe the\n  assertion will give us more clues if it happens again.\n\n- Supervisor would crash when run under Python 2.5 because the\n  xmlrpclib.Transport class in Python 2.5 changed in a\n  backward-incompatible way.  Thanks to Eric Westra for the bug\n  report and a fix.\n\n- Tests now pass under Python 2.5.\n\n- Better supervisorctl reporting on stop requests that have a FAILED\n  status.\n\n- Removed duplicated code (readLog/readMainLog), thanks to Mike\n  Naberezny.\n\n- Added tailProcessLog command to the XML-RPC API.  It provides a\n  more efficient way to tail logs than readProcessLog().  Use\n  readProcessLog() to read chunks and tailProcessLog() to tail.\n  (thanks to Mike Naberezny).\n\n2.1b1 (2006-08-30)\n------------------\n\n- \"supervisord -h\" and \"supervisorctl -h\" did not work (traceback\n  instead of showing help view (thanks to Damjan from Macedonia for\n  the bug report).\n\n- Processes which started successfully after failing to start\n  initially are no longer reported in BACKOFF state once they are\n  started successfully (thanks to Damjan from Macedonia for the bug\n  report).\n\n- Add new 'maintail' command to supervisorctl shell, which allows\n  you to tail the 'main' supervisor log.  This uses a new\n  readMainLog xmlrpc API.\n\n- Various process-state-transition related changes, all internal.\n  README.txt updated with new state transition map.\n\n- startProcess and startAllProcesses xmlrpc APIs changed: instead of\n  accepting a timeout integer, these accept a wait boolean (timeout\n  is implied by process' \"startsecs\" configuration).  If wait is\n  False, do not wait for startsecs.\n\nKnown issues:\n\n- Code does not match state transition map.  Processes which are\n  configured as autorestarting which start \"successfully\" but\n  subsequently die after 'startsecs' go through the transitions\n  RUNNING -> BACKOFF -> STARTING instead of the correct transitions\n  RUNNING -> EXITED -> STARTING.  This has no real negative effect,\n  but should be fixed for correctness.\n\n2.0 (2006-08-30)\n----------------\n\n- pidfile written in daemon mode had incorrect pid.\n\n- supervisorctl: tail (non -f) did not pass through proper error\n  messages when supplied by the server.\n\n- Log signal name used to kill processes at debug level.\n\n- supervisorctl \"tail -f\" didn't work with supervisorctl sections\n  configured with an absolute unix:// URL\n\n- New \"environment\" config file option allows you to add environment\n  variable values to supervisord environment from config file.\n\n2.0b1 (2006-07-12)\n------------------\n\n- Fundamental rewrite based on 1.0.7, use distutils (only) for\n  installation, use ConfigParser rather than ZConfig, use HTTP for\n  wire protocol, web interface, less lies in supervisorctl.\n\n1.0.7 (2006-07-11)\n------------------\n\n- Don't log a waitpid error if the error value is \"no children\".\n\n- Use select() against child file descriptor pipes and bump up select\n  timeout appropriately.\n\n1.0.6 (2005-11-20)\n------------------\n\n- Various tweaks to make run more effectively on Mac OS X\n  (including fixing tests to run there, no more \"error reading\n  from fd XXX\" in logtail output, reduced disk/CPU usage as a\n  result of not writing to log file unnecessarily on Mac OS).\n\n1.0.5 (2004-07-29)\n------------------\n\n- Short description: In previous releases, managed programs that\n  created voluminous stdout/stderr output could run more slowly\n  than usual when invoked under supervisor, now they do not.\n\n  Long description: The supervisord manages child output by\n  polling pipes related to child process stderr/stdout.  Polling\n  operations are performed in the mainloop, which also performs a\n  'select' on the filedescriptor(s) related to client/server\n  operations.  In prior releases, the select timeout was set to 2\n  seconds.  This release changes the timeout to 1/10th of a second\n  in order to keep up with client stdout/stderr output.\n\n  Gory description: On Linux, at least, there is a pipe buffer\n  size fixed by the kernel of somewhere between 512 - 4096 bytes;\n  when a child process writes enough data to fill the pipe buffer,\n  it will block on further stdout/stderr output until supervisord\n  comes along and clears out the buffer by reading bytes from the\n  pipe within the mainloop.  We now clear these buffers much more\n  quickly than we did before due to the increased frequency of\n  buffer reads in the mainloop; the timeout value of 1/10th of a\n  second seems to be fast enough to clear out the buffers of child\n  process pipes when managing programs on even a very fast system\n  while still enabling the supervisord process to be in a sleeping\n  state for most of the time.\n\n1.0.4 or \"Alpha 4\" (2004-06-30)\n-------------------------------\n\n- Forgot to update version tag in configure.py, so the supervisor version\n  in a3 is listed as \"1.0.1\", where it should be \"1.0.3\".  a4 will be\n  listed as \"1.0.4'.\n\n- Instead of preventing a process from starting if setuid() can't\n  be called (if supervisord is run as nonroot, for example), just log\n  the error and proceed.\n\n1.0.3 or \"Alpha 3\" (2004-05-26)\n-------------------------------\n\n- The daemon could chew up a lot of CPU time trying to select()\n  on real files (I didn't know select() failed to block when a file\n  is at EOF).  Fixed by polling instead of using select().\n\n- Processes could \"leak\" and become zombies due to a bug in\n  reaping dead children.\n\n- supervisord now defaults to daemonizing itself.\n\n- 'daemon' config file option and -d/--daemon command-line option\n  removed from supervisord acceptable options.  In place of these\n  options, we now have a 'nodaemon' config file option and a\n  -n/--nodaemon command-line option.\n\n- logtail now works.\n\n- pidproxy changed slightly to reap children synchronously.\n\n- in alpha2 changelist, supervisord was reported to have a\n  \"noauth\" command-line option.  This was not accurate.  The way\n  to turn off auth on the server is to disinclude the \"passwdfile\"\n  config file option from the server config file.  The client\n  however does indeed still have a noauth option, which prevents\n  it from ever attempting to send authentication credentials to\n  servers.\n\n- ZPL license added for ZConfig to LICENSE.txt\n\n1.0.2 or \"Alpha 2\" (Unreleased)\n-------------------------------\n\n- supervisorctl and supervisord no longer need to run on the same machine\n  due to the addition of internet socket support.\n\n- supervisorctl and supervisord no longer share a common configuration\n  file format.\n\n- supervisorctl now uses a persistent connection to supervisord\n  (as opposed to creating a fresh connection for each command).\n\n- SRP (Secure Remote Password) authentication is now a supported form\n  of access control for supervisord.  In supervisorctl interactive mode,\n  by default, users will be asked for credentials when attempting to\n  talk to a supervisord that requires SRP authentication.\n\n- supervisord has a new command-line option and configuration file\n  option for specifying \"noauth\" mode, which signifies that it\n  should not require authentication from clients.\n\n- supervisorctl has a new command-line option and configuration\n  option for specifying \"noauth\" mode, which signifies that it\n  should never attempt to send authentication info to servers.\n\n- supervisorctl has new commands: open: opens a connection to a new\n  supervisord; close: closes the current connection.\n\n- supervisorctl's \"logtail\" command now retrieves log data from\n  supervisord's log file remotely (as opposed to reading it\n  directly from a common filesystem).  It also no longer emulates\n  \"tail -f\", it just returns <n> lines of the server's log file.\n\n- The supervisord/supervisorctl wire protocol now has protocol versioning\n  and is documented in \"protocol.txt\".\n\n- \"configfile\" command-line override -C changed to -c\n\n- top-level section name for supervisor schema changed to 'supervisord'\n  from 'supervisor'\n\n- Added 'pidproxy' shim program.\n\nKnown issues in alpha 2:\n\n- If supervisorctl loses a connection to a supervisord or if the\n  remote supervisord crashes or shuts down unexpectedly, it is\n  possible that any supervisorctl talking to it will \"hang\"\n  indefinitely waiting for data.  Pressing Ctrl-C will allow you\n  to restart supervisorctl.\n\n- Only one supervisorctl process may talk to a given supervisord\n  process at a time.  If two supervisorctl processes attempt to talk\n  to the same supervisord process, one will \"win\" and the other will\n  be disconnected.\n\n- Sometimes if a pidproxy is used to start a program, the pidproxy\n  program itself will \"leak\".\n\n1.0.0 or \"Alpha 1\" (Unreleased)\n-------------------------------\n\nInitial release.\n","description_content_type":"","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"http://supervisord.org/","keywords":"","license":"BSD-derived
