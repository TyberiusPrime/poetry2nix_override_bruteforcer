Developed by [Humboldt University of Berlin](https://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/en/forschung-en/gebiete/ml-en/) and friends.\n\n---\n\nFlair is:\n\n* **A powerful NLP library.** Flair allows you to apply our state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP)\nmodels to your text, such as named entity recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging (PoS),\n  special support for [biomedical data](/resources/docs/HUNFLAIR.md),\n sense disambiguation and classification, with support for a rapidly growing number of languages.\n\n* **A text embedding library.** Flair has simple interfaces that allow you to use and combine different word and\ndocument embeddings, including our proposed [Flair embeddings](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1139/) and various transformers.\n\n* **A PyTorch NLP framework.** Our framework builds directly on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), making it easy to\ntrain your own models and experiment with new approaches using Flair embeddings and classes.\n\nNow at [version 0.13.1(https://github.com/flairNLP/flair/releases)!\n\n\n## State-of-the-Art Models\n\nFlair ships with state-of-the-art models for a range of NLP tasks. For instance, check out our latest NER models:\n\n| Language | Dataset | Flair | Best published | Model card & demo\n|  ---  | ----------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| English | Conll-03 (4-class)   |  **94.09**  | *94.3 [(Yamada et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.emnlp-main.523)* | [Flair English 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-english-large)  |\n| English | Ontonotes (18-class)  |  **90.93**  | *91.3 [(Yu et al., 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair English 18-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-english-ontonotes-large) |\n| German  | Conll-03 (4-class)   |  **92.31**  | *90.3 [(Yu et al., 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair German 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-german-large)  |\n| Dutch  | Conll-03  (4-class)  |  **95.25**  | *93.7 [(Yu et al., 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair Dutch 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-dutch-large)  |\n| Spanish  | Conll-03 (4-class)   |  **90.54** | *90.3 [(Yu et al., 2020)](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.577.pdf)* | [Flair Spanish 4-class NER demo](https://huggingface.co/flair/ner-spanish-large)  |\n\nMany Flair sequence tagging models (named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging etc.) are also hosted\non the [__🤗 Hugging Face model hub__](https://huggingface.co/models?library=flair&sort=downloads)! You can browse models, check detailed information on how they were trained, and even try each model out online!\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Requirements and Installation\n\nIn your favorite virtual environment, simply do:\n\n```\npip install flair\n```\n\nFlair requires Python 3.8+. \n\n### Example 1: Tag Entities in Text\n\nLet's run **named entity recognition** (NER) over an example sentence. All you need to do is make a `Sentence`, load\na pre-trained model and use it to predict tags for the sentence:\n\n```python\nfrom flair.data import Sentence\nfrom flair.nn import Classifier\n\n# make a sentence\nsentence = Sentence('I love Berlin .')\n\n# load the NER tagger\ntagger = Classifier.load('ner')\n\n# run NER over sentence\ntagger.predict(sentence)\n\n# print the sentence with all annotations\nprint(sentence)\n```\n\nThis should print:\n\n```console\nSentence: \"I love Berlin .\" → [\"Berlin\"/LOC]\n```\n\nThis means that \"Berlin\" was tagged as a **location entity** in this sentence. \n\n   * *to learn more about NER tagging in Flair, check out our [NER tutorial](https://flairnlp.github.io/docs/tutorial-basics/tagging-entities)!*\n\n\n### Example 2: Detect Sentiment \n\nLet's run **sentiment analysis** over an example sentence to determine whether it is POSITIVE or NEGATIVE.\nSame code as above, just a different model: \n\n```python\nfrom flair.data import Sentence\nfrom flair.nn import Classifier\n\n# make a sentence\nsentence = Sentence('I love Berlin .')\n\n# load the NER tagger\ntagger = Classifier.load('sentiment')\n\n# run NER over sentence\ntagger.predict(sentence)\n\n# print the sentence with all annotations\nprint(sentence)\n```\n\nThis should print:\n\n```console\nSentence[4]: \"I love Berlin .\" → POSITIVE (0.9983)\n```\n\nThis means that the sentence \"I love Berlin\" was tagged as having **POSITIVE** sentiment. \n\n   * *to learn more about sentiment analysis in Flair, check out our [sentiment analysis tutorial](https://flairnlp.github.io/docs/tutorial-basics/tagging-sentiment)!*\n\n## Tutorials\n\nOn our new :fire: [**Flair documentation page**](https://flairnlp.github.io/docs/intro) you will find many tutorials to get you started!\n\nIn particular: \n- [Tutorial 1: Basic tagging](https://flairnlp.github.io/docs/category/tutorial-1-basic-tagging) → how to tag your text \n- [Tutorial 2: Training models](https://flairnlp.github.io/docs/category/tutorial-2-training-models) → how to train your own state-of-the-art NLP models \n- [Tutorial 3: Embeddings](https://flairnlp.github.io/docs/category/tutorial-3-embeddings) → how to produce embeddings for words and documents\n\nThere is also a dedicated landing page for our [biomedical NER and datasets](/resources/docs/HUNFLAIR.md) with\ninstallation instructions and tutorials.\n\n\n## More Documentation\n\nAnother great place to start is the book [Natural Language Processing with Flair](https://www.amazon.com/Natural-Language-Processing-Flair-understanding/dp/1801072310)\nand its accompanying [code repository](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Natural-Language-Processing-with-Flair), though it was\nwritten for an older version of Flair and some examples may no longer work.\n\nThere are also
