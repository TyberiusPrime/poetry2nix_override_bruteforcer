This ensures\nthat the temporary file resides on the same filesystem.\n\nThe temporary file will then be atomically moved to the target location: On\nPOSIX, it will use ``rename`` if files should be overwritten, otherwise a\ncombination of ``link`` and ``unlink``. On Windows, it uses MoveFileEx_ through\nstdlib's ``ctypes`` with the appropriate flags.\n\nNote that with ``link`` and ``unlink``, there's a timewindow where the file\nmight be available under two entries in the filesystem: The name of the\ntemporary file, and the name of the target file.\n\nAlso note that the permissions of the target file may change this way. In some\nsituations a ``chmod`` can be issued without any concurrency problems, but\nsince that is not always the case, this library doesn't do it by itself.\n\n.. _MoveFileEx: https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365240%28v=vs.85%29.aspx\n\nfsync\n-----\n\nOn POSIX, ``fsync`` is invoked on the temporary file after it is written (to\nflush file content and metadata), and on the parent directory after the file is\nmoved (to flush filename).\n\n``fsync`` does not take care of disks' internal buffers, but there don't seem\nto be any standard POSIX APIs for that. On OS X, ``fcntl`` is used with\n``F_FULLFSYNC`` instead of ``fsync`` for that reason.\n\nOn Windows, `_commit <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/17618685.aspx>`_\nis used, but there are no guarantees about disk internal buffers.\n\nAlternatives and Credit\n=======================\n\nAtomicwrites is directly inspired by the following libraries (and shares a\nminimal amount of code):\n\n- The Trac project's `utility functions\n  <http://www.edgewall.org/docs/tags-trac-0.11.7/epydoc/trac.util-pysrc.html>`_,\n  also used in `Werkzeug <http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/>`_ and\n  `mitsuhiko/python-atomicfile\n  <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/python-atomicfile>`_. The idea to use\n  ``ctypes`` instead of ``PyWin32`` originated there.\n\n- `abarnert/fatomic <https://github.com/abarnert/fatomic>`_. Windows support\n  (based on ``PyWin32``) was originally taken from there.\n\nOther alternatives to atomicwrites include:\n\n- `sashka/atomicfile <https://github.com/sashka/atomicfile>`_. Originally I\n  considered using that, but at the time it was lacking a lot of features I\n  needed (Windows support, overwrite-parameter, overriding behavior through\n  subclassing).\n\n- The `Boltons library collection <https://github.com/mahmoud/boltons>`_\n  features a class for atomic file writes, which seems to have a very similar\n  ``overwrite`` parameter. It is lacking Windows support though.\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nLicensed under the MIT, see ``LICENSE``.\n","description_content_type":"","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites","keywords":"","license":"MIT","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"atomicwrites-homeassistant","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/atomicwrites-homeassistant/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/atomicwrites-homeassistant/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/atomicwrites-homeassistant/1.4.1/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":">=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*","summary":"Atomic file writes.","version":"1.4.1","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":14379290,"releases":{"1.4.1":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"4e1b872dd3b11939edb4c0a27d2569a9b7e77d3b88995a45a331f376e13528c0","md5":"8775e4a5e54408989dc49b2d6ac13b2c","sha256":"01457de800961db7d5b575f3c92e7fb56e435d88512c366afb0873f4f092bb0d"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"atomicwrites_homeassistant-1.4.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"8775e4a5e54408989dc49b2d6ac13b2c","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py2.py3","requires_python":">=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*","size":7128,"upload_time":"2022-07-08T20:56:44","upload_time_iso_8601":"2022-07-08T20:56:44.186581Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/4e/1b/872dd3b11939edb4c0a27d2569a9b7e77d3b88995a45a331f376e13528c0/atomicwrites_homeassistant-1.4.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"9a5a10ff0fd9aa04f78a0b31bb617c8d29796a12bea33f1e48aa54687d635e44","md5":"fcc36e72ede8c6b4c8c0a672bdaa9120","sha256":"256a672106f16745445228d966240b77b55f46a096d20305901a57aa5d1f4c2f"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"atomicwrites-homeassistant-1.4.1.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"fcc36e72ede8c6b4c8c0a672bdaa9120","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*","size":12223,"upload_time":"2022-07-08T20:56:46","upload_time_iso_8601":"2022-07-08T20:56:46.350518Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/9a/5a/10ff0fd9aa04f78a0b31bb617c8d29796a12bea33f1e48aa54687d635e44/atomicwrites-homeassistant-1.4.1.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"4e1b872dd3b11939edb4c0a27d2569a9b7e77d3b88995a45a331f376e13528c0","md5":"8775e4a5e54408989dc49b2d6ac13b2c","sha256":"01457de800961db7d5b575f3c92e7fb56e435d88512c366afb0873f4f092bb0d"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"atomicwrites_homeassistant-1.4.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"8775e4a5e54408989dc49b2d6ac13b2c","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py2.py3","requires_python":">=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*","size":7128,"upload_time":"2022-07-08T20:56:44","upload_time_iso_8601":"2022-07-08T20:56:44.186581Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/4e/1b/872dd3b11939edb4c0a27d2569a9b7e77d3b88995a45a331f376e13528c0/atomicwrites_homeassistant-1.4.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"9a5a10ff0fd9aa04f78a0b31bb617c8d29796a12bea33f1e48aa54687d635e44","md5":"fcc36e72ede8c6b4c8c0a672bdaa9120","sha256":"256a672106f16745445228d966240b77b55f46a096d20305901a57aa5d1f4c2f"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"atomicwrites-homeassistant-1.4.1.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"fcc36e72ede8c6b4c8c0a672bdaa9120","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=2.7, !=3.0.*, !=3.1.*, !=3.2.*, !=3.3.*","size":12223,"upload_time":"2022-07-08T20:56:46","upload_time_iso_8601":"2022-07-08T20:56:46.350518Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/9a/5a/10ff0fd9aa04f78a0b31bb617c8d29796a12bea33f1e48aa54687d635e44/atomicwrites-homeassistant-1.4.1.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
