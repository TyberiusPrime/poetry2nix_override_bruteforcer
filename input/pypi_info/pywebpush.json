I still accept PRs and Issues, but\nmake of that what you will.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo work with this repo locally, you'll need to run `python -m venv venv`.\nThen `venv/bin/pip install --editable .`\n\n\n## Usage\n\nIn the browser, the promise handler for\n[registration.pushManager.subscribe()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushManager/subscribe)\nreturns a\n[PushSubscription](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PushSubscription)\nobject. This object has a .toJSON() method that will return a JSON object that contains all the info we need to encrypt\nand push data.\n\nAs illustration, a `subscription_info` object may look like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"endpoint\": \"https://updates.push.services.mozilla.com/push/v1/gAA...\",\n  \"keys\": { \"auth\": \"k8J...\", \"p256dh\": \"BOr...\" }\n}\n```\n\nHow you send the PushSubscription data to your backend, store it\nreferenced to the user who requested it, and recall it when there's\na new push subscription update is left as an exercise for the\nreader.\n\n### Sending Data using `webpush()` One Call\n\nIn many cases, your code will be sending a single message to many\nrecipients. There's a \"One Call\" function which will make things\neasier.\n\n```python\nfrom pywebpush import webpush\n\nwebpush(subscription_info,\n        data,\n        vapid_private_key=\"Private Key or File Path[1]\",\n        vapid_claims={\"sub\": \"mailto:YourEmailAddress\"})\n```\n\nThis will encode `data`, add the appropriate VAPID auth headers if required and send it to the push server identified\nin the `subscription_info` block.\n\n##### Parameters\n\n_subscription_info_ - The `dict` of the subscription info (described above).\n\n_data_ - can be any serial content (string, bit array, serialized JSON, etc), but be sure that your receiving\napplication is able to parse and understand it. (e.g. `data = \"Mary had a little lamb.\"`)\n\n_content_type_ - specifies the form of Encryption to use, either `'aes128gcm'` or the deprecated `'aesgcm'`. NOTE that\nnot all User Agents can decrypt `'aesgcm'`, so the library defaults to the RFC 8188 standard form.\n\n_vapid_claims_ - a `dict` containing the VAPID claims required for authorization (See\n[py_vapid](https://github.com/web-push-libs/vapid/tree/master/python) for more details). If `aud` is not specified,\npywebpush will attempt to auto-fill from the `endpoint`. If `exp` is not specified or set in the past, it will be set\nto 12 hours from now. In both cases, the passed `dict` **will be mutated** after the call.\n\n_vapid_private_key_ - Either a path to a VAPID EC2 private key PEM file, or a string containing the DER representation.\n(See [py_vapid](https://github.com/web-push-libs/vapid/tree/master/python) for more details.) The `private_key` may be\na base64 encoded DER formatted private key, or the path to an OpenSSL exported private key file.\n\ne.g. the output of:\n\n```bash\nopenssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out private_key.pem\n```\n\n##### Example\n\n```python\nfrom pywebpush import webpush, WebPushException\n\ntry:\n    webpush(\n        subscription_info={\n            \"endpoint\": \"https://push.example.com/v1/12345\",\n            \"keys\": {\n                \"p256dh\": \"0123abcde...\",\n                \"auth\": \"abc123...\"\n            }},\n        data=\"Mary had a little lamb, with a nice mint jelly\",\n        vapid_private_key=\"path/to/vapid_private.pem\",\n        vapid_claims={\n                \"sub\": \"mailto:YourNameHere@example.org\",\n            }\n    )\nexcept WebPushException as ex:\n    print(\"I'm sorry, Dave, but I can't do that: {}\", repr(ex))\n    # Mozilla returns additional information in the body of the response.\n    if ex.response and ex.response.json():\n        extra = ex.response.json()\n        print(\"Remote service replied with a {}:{}, {}\",\n              extra.code,\n              extra.errno,\n              extra.message\n              )\n```\n\n### Methods\n\nIf you expect to resend to the same recipient, or have more needs than just sending data quickly, you\ncan pass just `wp = WebPusher(subscription_info)`. This will return a `WebPusher` object.\n\nThe following methods are available:\n\n#### `.send(data, headers={}, ttl=0, gcm_key=\"\", reg_id=\"\", content_encoding=\"aes128gcm\", curl=False, timeout=None)`\n\nSend the data using additional parameters. On error, returns a `WebPushException`\n\n##### Parameters\n\n_data_ Binary string of data to send\n\n_headers_ A `dict` containing any additional headers to send\n\n_ttl_ Message Time To Live on Push Server waiting for the client to reconnect (in seconds)\n\n_gcm_key_ Google Cloud Messaging key (if using the older GCM push system) This is the API key obtained from the Google\nDeveloper Console.\n\n_reg_id_ Google Cloud Messaging registration ID (will be extracted from endpoint if not specified)\n\n_content_encoding_ ECE content encoding type (defaults to \"aes128gcm\")\n\n_curl_ Do not execute the POST, but return as a `curl` command. This will write the encrypted content to a local file\nnamed `encrpypted.data`. This command is meant to be used for debugging purposes.\n\n_timeout_ timeout for requests POST query.\nSee [requests documentation](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/quickstart/#timeouts).\n\n##### Example\n\nto send from Chrome using the old GCM mode:\n\n```python\nWebPusher(subscription_info).send(data, headers, ttl, gcm_key)\n```\n\n#### `.encode(data, content_encoding=\"aes128gcm\")`\n\nEncode the `data` for future use. On error, returns a `WebPushException`\n\n##### Parameters\n\n_data_ Binary string of data to send\n\n_content_encoding_ ECE content encoding type (defaults to \"aes128gcm\")\n\n*Note* This will return a `NoData` exception if the data is not present or empty. It is completely\nvalid to send a WebPush notification with no data, but encoding is a no-op in that case. Best not\nto call it if you don't have data.\n\n##### Example\n\n```python\nencoded_data = WebPush(subscription_info).encode(data)\n```\n\n## Stand Alone Webpush\n\nIf you're not really into coding your own solution, there's also a \"stand-alone\" `pywebpush` command in the\n./bin directory.\n\nThis uses two files:\n\n- the _data_ file, which contains the message to send, in whatever form you like.\n- the _subscription info_ file, which contains the subscription information as JSON encoded data. This is usually returned by the Push `subscribe` method and looks something like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"endpoint\": \"https://push...\",\n  \"keys\": {\n    \"auth\": \"ab01...\",\n    \"p256dh\": \"aa02...\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf you're interested in just testing your applications WebPush interface, you could use the Command Line:\n\n```bash\n./bin/pywebpush --data stuff_to_send.data --info subscription.info\n```\n\nwhich will encrypt and send the contents of `stuff_to_send.data`.\n\nSee `./bin/pywebpush --help` for available commands and options.\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/web-push-libs/pywebpush","keywords":"webpush,vapid,notification","license":"Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 ==================================  1.

Conditions  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in Section 2.1.  3. Responsibilities -------------------  3.1. Distribution of Source Form  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:  (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and  (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary License(s).  3.4. Notices  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.  3.5. Application of Additional Terms  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any jurisdiction.  4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation ---------------------------------------------------  If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.  5. Termination --------------  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.  5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination shall survive termination.  ************************************************************************ *                                                                      * *  6.
