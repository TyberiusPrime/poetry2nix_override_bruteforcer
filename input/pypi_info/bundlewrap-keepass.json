It should contain two lines: First\nline should contain a path to your keepass file, second line may contain\nyour password.\n\nIf you're not comfortable putting your password into a plain-text file,\nyou may also use `BW_KEEPASS_PASSWORD` in your environment variables.\n\nYou may also set `BW_KEEPASS_FILE` in your environment to overwrite the\nlocation of your keepass file. Please note that if you set the file path\nin your environment, you *must* also set the password.\n\n# Usage\n\nAll function calls accept lists or strings as their arguments. If you\nneed to traverse into subdirectories in your keepass file, you have to\nuse `|` as separator when not using lists.\n\nFor example, if you want to access the Password for 'mysite', which is\nlocated inside the directory 'bundlewrap', you can use either one of\nthese:\n\n```\nbwkeepass.password('bundlewrap|mysite')\nbwkeepass.password(['bundlewrap', 'mysite'])\n```\n\nExample `nodes.py`:\n\n```python\nimport bwkeepass as keepass\n\nnodes = {\n    'somenode': {\n        'metadata': {\n            'my_secret': keepass.password('my_identifier'),\n        },\n    },\n}\n```\n\nAvailable Fields/Methods are:\n- `bwkeepass.password()` for passwords\n- `bwkeepass.username()` for usernames\n- `bwkeepass.url()` for urls\n- `bwkeepass.notes()` for notes\n\nNote: This will insert a proxy object into your metadata, the actual secret is not retrieved until you convert it to a string (e.g. by inserting it in a template or calling str() explicitly).\n\n---\n\nÂ© 2021 [Franziska Kunsmann](mailto:pypi@kunsmann.eu)\n\n\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"","keywords":"configuration,config,management","license":"GPLv3","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"bundlewrap-keepass","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/bundlewrap-keepass/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/bundlewrap-keepass/","project_urls":null,"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/bundlewrap-keepass/0.1.0/","requires_dist":["bundlewrap (>=4.0.0)","pykeepass (>=4.0.0)"],"requires_python":"","summary":"Use Keepass passwords in your bundlewrap repo","version":"0.1.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":10815599,"releases":{"0.1.0":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"fcd1381f2a016739732cdb96098b6f924f3e9fc1f1c486f02b0323391282412a","md5":"00d198f4009e93889f28a22b59356bb7","sha256":"b2d2fe46c327fa5d0785c31647e2cdbbf45b0191ebffe897865b1fda72508c82"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"bundlewrap_keepass-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"00d198f4009e93889f28a22b59356bb7","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":null,"size":15716,"upload_time":"2021-07-03T17:48:08","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-07-03T17:48:08.092526Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/fc/d1/381f2a016739732cdb96098b6f924f3e9fc1f1c486f02b0323391282412a/bundlewrap_keepass-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"87db8c0e132de992d7a80aea586685575ee9ebcc4563c763c63238471243a1ed","md5":"6c73f5b6147f5c9a864cdd4176b5f3c6","sha256":"3f8d55b48f1522a4a9d485deedfcca0c11a69979832d19bbbf5a95d60df9202e"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"bundlewrap-keepass-0.1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"6c73f5b6147f5c9a864cdd4176b5f3c6","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":15559,"upload_time":"2021-07-03T17:48:09","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-07-03T17:48:09.849507Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/87/db/8c0e132de992d7a80aea586685575ee9ebcc4563c763c63238471243a1ed/bundlewrap-keepass-0.1.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"fcd1381f2a016739732cdb96098b6f924f3e9fc1f1c486f02b0323391282412a","md5":"00d198f4009e93889f28a22b59356bb7","sha256":"b2d2fe46c327fa5d0785c31647e2cdbbf45b0191ebffe897865b1fda72508c82"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"bundlewrap_keepass-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"00d198f4009e93889f28a22b59356bb7","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":null,"size":15716,"upload_time":"2021-07-03T17:48:08","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-07-03T17:48:08.092526Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/fc/d1/381f2a016739732cdb96098b6f924f3e9fc1f1c486f02b0323391282412a/bundlewrap_keepass-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"87db8c0e132de992d7a80aea586685575ee9ebcc4563c763c63238471243a1ed","md5":"6c73f5b6147f5c9a864cdd4176b5f3c6","sha256":"3f8d55b48f1522a4a9d485deedfcca0c11a69979832d19bbbf5a95d60df9202e"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"bundlewrap-keepass-0.1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"6c73f5b6147f5c9a864cdd4176b5f3c6","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":15559,"upload_time":"2021-07-03T17:48:09","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-07-03T17:48:09.849507Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/87/db/8c0e132de992d7a80aea586685575ee9ebcc4563c763c63238471243a1ed/bundlewrap-keepass-0.1.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
