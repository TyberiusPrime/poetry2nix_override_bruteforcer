In order to know how to use it, please refer to the `Silva\ndeveloper documentation`_.\n\nCustom injector\n===============\n\nThis package provides a custom fanstatic injector called rules. It\ncan be used like this inside the Paster configuration::\n\n  injector = rules\n  rules =\n     if there is <!-- Here goes Fanstatic top CSS -->\n     replace with all css resources\n\n     if there is <!-- Here goes Fanstatic top JS -->\n     replace with all js top resources\n\n     if there is <!-- Here goes Fanstatic bottom JS -->\n     replace with all js bottom resources\n\n     otherwise\n     insert before </head>\n\nThe rules let you look for specific markup in the generated HTML and\nwill insert the resources around them, if present.\n\n\nAdditional API\n==============\n\nThis package provides additional objects ``ExternalResources`` and\n``Snippet`` in order to include external URLs as resources and\ninline snippets too.\n\n\nCode repository\n===============\n\nYou can find the code of this extension in Git:\nhttps://github.com/silvacms/silva.fanstatic.\n\n\n.. _fanstatic: http://www.fanstatic.org\n.. _Silva developer documentation: http://docs.silvacms.org/latest/\n\nChanges\n=======\n\n1.2 (2013/10/08)\n----------------\n\n* Add a Fanstatic injector called ``rules`` that let you described\n  precisely where resources should be injected.

This ensure to create\n  the same URLs accross multiple servers.\n\n1.1 (2012/09/03)\n----------------\n\n* Automatically use ``*.min.ext`` file as a minified version for a\n  given ``*.ext`` file if it is present.\n\n1.0 (2011/11/08)\n----------------\n\n* Initial release.","description_content_type":null,"docs_url":null,"download_url":"UNKNOWN","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/silvacms/silva.fanstatic","keywords":"zope2 fanstatic silva","license":"BSD","maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"name":"silva.fanstatic","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/silva.fanstatic/","platform":"UNKNOWN","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/silva.fanstatic/","project_urls":{"Download":"UNKNOWN","Homepage":"https://github.com/silvacms/silva.fanstatic"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/silva.fanstatic/1.2/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":null,"summary":"Integration of fanstatic in Silva CMS","version":"1.2","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":945565,"releases":{"1.2":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"aa9a590fdc9f8e4e6d1def8c09ee095f431e1e526ecda841f8d309425e2832b5","md5":"0890fad877e1591a55a19068ec8d7272","sha256":"8be9110d7153aa73d6fccd1ab4a7f126b715759615664f640ae53cf78358370b"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"silva.fanstatic-1.2.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"0890fad877e1591a55a19068ec8d7272","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":13289,"upload_time":"2013-12-16T12:44:09","upload_time_iso_8601":"2013-12-16T12:44:09.216307Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/aa/9a/590fdc9f8e4e6d1def8c09ee095f431e1e526ecda841f8d309425e2832b5/silva.fanstatic-1.2.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"aa9a590fdc9f8e4e6d1def8c09ee095f431e1e526ecda841f8d309425e2832b5","md5":"0890fad877e1591a55a19068ec8d7272","sha256":"8be9110d7153aa73d6fccd1ab4a7f126b715759615664f640ae53cf78358370b"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"silva.fanstatic-1.2.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"0890fad877e1591a55a19068ec8d7272","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":13289,"upload_time":"2013-12-16T12:44:09","upload_time_iso_8601":"2013-12-16T12:44:09.216307Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/aa/9a/590fdc9f8e4e6d1def8c09ee095f431e1e526ecda841f8d309425e2832b5/silva.fanstatic-1.2.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
