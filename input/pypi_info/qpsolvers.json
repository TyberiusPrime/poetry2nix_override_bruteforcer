The function returns the primal solution $x^\\*$ found by the backend QP solver, or ``None`` in case of failure/unfeasible problem. All solvers require the problem to be convex, meaning the matrix $P$ should be [positive semi-definite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definite_symmetric_matrix). Some solvers further require the problem to be strictly convex, meaning $P$ should be positive definite.\n\n**Dual multipliers:** there is also a [`solve_problem`](https://qpsolvers.github.io/qpsolvers/quadratic-programming.html#qpsolvers.solve_problem) function that returns not only the primal solution, but also its dual multipliers and all other relevant quantities computed by the backend solver.\n\n## Example\n\nTo solve a quadratic program, build the matrices that define it and call ``solve_qp``, selecting the backend QP solver via the ``solver`` keyword argument:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom qpsolvers import solve_qp\n\nM = np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 0.0], [-8.0, 3.0, 2.0], [0.0, 1.0, 1.0]])\nP = M.T @ M  # this is a positive definite matrix\nq = np.array([3.0, 2.0, 3.0]) @ M\nG = np.array([[1.0, 2.0, 1.0], [2.0, 0.0, 1.0], [-1.0, 2.0, -1.0]])\nh = np.array([3.0, 2.0, -2.0])\nA = np.array([1.0, 1.0, 1.0])\nb = np.array([1.0])\n\nx = solve_qp(P, q, G, h, A, b, solver=\"proxqp\")\nprint(f\"QP solution: {x = }\")\n```\n\nThis example outputs the solution ``[0.30769231, -0.69230769,  1.38461538]``. It is also possible to get dual multipliers at the solution, as shown in [this example](https://qpsolvers.github.io/qpsolvers/quadratic-programming.html#dual-multipliers).\n\n## Installation\n\n### PyPI\n\n[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/qpsolvers)](https://pypi.org/project/qpsolvers/)\n\nTo install the library with open source QP solvers:\n\n```console\npip install qpsolvers[open_source_solvers]\n```\n\nThis one-size-fits-all installation may not work immediately on all systems (for instance if [a solver tries to compile from source](https://github.com/quadprog/quadprog/issues/42)). If you run into any issue, check out the following variants:\n\n- ``pip install qpsolvers[wheels_only]`` will only install solvers with pre-compiled binaries,\n- ``pip install qpsolvers[clarabel,daqp,proxqp,scs]`` (for instance) will install the listed set of QP solvers,\n- ``pip install qpsolvers`` will only install the library itself.\n\nWhen imported, qpsolvers loads all the solvers it can find and lists them in ``qpsolvers.available_solvers``.\n\n### Conda\n\n[![Conda version](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qpsolvers/badges/version.svg)](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/qpsolvers)\n\n```console\nconda install -c conda-forge qpsolvers\n```\n\n## Solvers\n\n| Solver | Keyword | Algorithm | API | License | Warm-start |\n| ------ | ------- | --------- | --- | ------- |------------|\n| [Clarabel](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/Clarabel.rs) | ``clarabel`` | Interior point | Sparse | Apache-2.0 | ✖️ |\n| [CVXOPT](http://cvxopt.org/) | ``cvxopt`` | Interior point | Dense | GPL-3.0 | ✔️ |\n| [DAQP](https://github.com/darnstrom/daqp) | ``daqp`` | Active set | Dense | MIT | ✖️ |\n| [ECOS](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/ecos.html) | ``ecos`` | Interior point | Sparse | GPL-3.0 | ✖️ |\n| [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/) | ``gurobi`` | Interior point | Sparse | Commercial | ✖️ |\n| [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/) | ``highs`` | Active set | Sparse | MIT | ✖️ |\n| [HPIPM](https://github.com/giaf/hpipm) | ``hpipm`` | Interior point | Dense | BSD-2-Clause | ✔️ |\n| [MOSEK](https://mosek.com/) | ``mosek`` | Interior point | Sparse | Commercial | ✔️ |\n| NPPro | ``nppro`` | Active set | Dense | Commercial | ✔️ |\n| [OSQP](https://osqp.org/) | ``osqp`` | Augmented Lagrangian | Sparse | Apache-2.0 | ✔️ |\n| [PIQP](https://github.com/PREDICT-EPFL/piqp) | ``piqp`` | Proximal Interior Point | Dense & Sparse | BSD-2-Clause | ✖️ |\n| [ProxQP](https://github.com/Simple-Robotics/proxsuite) | ``proxqp`` | Augmented Lagrangian | Dense & Sparse | BSD-2-Clause | ✔️ |\n| [QPALM](https://github.com/kul-optec/QPALM) | ``qpalm`` | Augmented Lagrangian | Sparse | LGPL-3.0 | ✔️ |\n| [qpOASES](https://github.com/coin-or/qpOASES) | ``qpoases`` | Active set | Dense | LGPL-2.1 | ➖ |\n| [qpSWIFT](https://github.com/qpSWIFT/qpSWIFT) | ``qpswift`` | Interior point | Sparse | GPL-3.0 | ✖️ |\n| [quadprog](https://github.com/quadprog/quadprog) | ``quadprog`` | Active set | Dense | GPL-2.0 | ✖️ |\n| [SCS](https://www.cvxgrp.org/scs/) | ``scs`` | Augmented Lagrangian | Sparse | MIT | ✔️ |\n\nMatrix arguments are NumPy arrays for dense solvers and SciPy Compressed Sparse Column (CSC) matrices for sparse ones.\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- [Can I print the list of solvers available on my machine?](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpsolvers/discussions/37)\n- [Is it possible to solve a least squares rather than a quadratic program?](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpsolvers/discussions/223)\n- [I have a squared norm in my cost function, how can I apply a QP solver to my problem?](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpsolvers/discussions/224)\n- [I have a non-convex quadratic program, is there a solver I can use?](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpsolvers/discussions/240)\n- [I have quadratic equality constraints, is there a solver I can use?](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpsolvers/discussions/241)\n- [Error: Mircrosoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required on Windows](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpsolvers/discussions/257)\n- [Can I add penalty terms as in ridge regression or LASSO?](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpsolvers/discussions/272)\n\n## Benchmark\n\nThe results below come from [`qpbenchmark`](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark), a benchmark for QP solvers in Python. In the following tables, solvers are called with their default settings and compared over whole test sets by [shifted geometric mean](https://github.com/qpsolvers/qpbenchmark#shifted-geometric-mean) (\"shm\" for short). Lower is better and 1.0 corresponds to the best solver.\n\n### Maros-Meszaros (hard problems)\n\nCheck out the [full
