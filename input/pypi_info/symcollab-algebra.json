What it generates resembles a tree. The \"top\" will be a function (for a non-trivial term) and each function points to its arguments. The \"leaves\" would be a constant or a variable.\n\nFor example, take the term `f(g(x, a), g(x, a))`\n\n![img](example_graph.png)\n\nThe function `f` has two arguments, both of which is `g(x,a)`. Therefore, `f` points to `g`.  Since both the arguments are `g(x,a)`, we just have one node `g` that points to `x` and `a`.\n\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/symcollab/cryptosolve","keywords":"","license":"","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"symcollab-algebra","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/symcollab-algebra/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/symcollab-algebra/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://github.com/symcollab/cryptosolve"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/symcollab-algebra/0.1.1/","requires_dist":["matplotlib
