Unless you\n*really* have to use Python 2, you should go to the `pythondialog home\npage`_ and download the reference implementation which, at the time of\nthis writing (December 2019) and for the foreseeable future, is targeted\nat Python 3.\n\n.. _pythondialog home page: http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/\n\nThis version is only here to help users who are somehow forced to still\nuse Python 2, even though Python 3.0 was released on December 3, 2008.\nPython 2 has `reached its end of life\n<https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/>`_, and so does this\nbackport. **This backport is now unsupported. Don't expect any further\nupdates.**\n\nIf, despite all of these warnings, you still want to use it, be sure to\nread the `Backport-specific notes`_ below.\n\n\nOverview\n--------\n\npythondialog is a Python wrapper for the UNIX dialog_ utility\noriginally written by Savio Lam and later rewritten by Thomas E. Dickey.\nIts purpose is to provide an easy to use, pythonic and as complete as\npossible interface to dialog_ from Python code.\n\n.. _dialog: https://invisible-island.net/dialog/dialog.html\n\npythondialog is free software, licensed under the GNU LGPL (GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License). Its home page is located at:\n\n  http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/\n\nand contains a `short example`_, screenshots_, a `summary of the recent\nchanges`_, links to the `documentation`_, the `Git repository`_, the\n`mailing list`_, the `issue tracker`_, etc.\n\n.. _short example:  http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/#example\n.. _screenshots:    http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/gallery.html\n.. _summary of the recent changes:\n                    http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/news.html\n.. _documentation:  http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/doc/\n.. _Git repository: https://sourceforge.net/p/pythondialog/code/\n.. _mailing list:   https://sourceforge.net/p/pythondialog/mailman/\n.. _issue tracker:  https://sourceforge.net/p/pythondialog/_list/tickets\n\nIf you want to get a quick idea of what this module allows one to do,\nyou can download a release tarball and run ``demo.py``::\n\n  PYTHONPATH=. python2 examples/demo.py\n\nNotes:\n\n  - the preceding command uses ``python2`` because we want to use the\n    Python 2 backport of pythondialog;\n  - depending on your system, you may have to replace ``python2`` with\n    ``python`` or ``python2.7``, for instance.\n\n\nWhat is pythondialog good for? What are its limitations?\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAs you might infer from the name, dialog is a high-level program that\ngenerates dialog boxes. So is pythondialog. They allow you to build nice\ninterfaces quickly and easily, but you don't have full control over the\nwidgets, nor can you create new widgets without modifying dialog itself.\nIf you need to do low-level stuff, you should have a look at `ncurses`_\n(cf. the ``curses`` module in the Python standard library), `blessings`_\nor slang instead. For sophisticated text-mode interfaces, the `Urwid\nPython library`_ looks rather interesting, too.\n\n.. _ncurses: https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.html\n.. _blessings: https://github.com/erikrose/blessings\n.. _Urwid Python library: http://excess.org/urwid/\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* This **now unsupported** backport of pythondialog requires Python 2.6\n  or later in the 2.x series. It has been tested with Python 2.7.\n\n* The reference implementation supports more recent versions of the\n  Python interpreter. Please visit the `pythondialog home page`_ for\n  more information.\n\n* Apart from that, pythondialog requires the dialog_ program (or a\n  drop-in replacement for dialog). You can download dialog from:\n\n    https://invisible-island.net/dialog/dialog.html\n\n  Note that some features of pythondialog may require recent versions of\n  dialog.\n\n\nQuick installation instructions\n-------------------------------\n\nIf you have a working `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`_ setup,\nyou should be able to install this backport of pythondialog with::\n\n  pip install python2-pythondialog\n\nWhen doing so, make sure that your ``pip`` executable runs with the\nPython 2 installation you want to install the backport for.\n\nFor more detailed instructions, you can read the ``INSTALL`` file from a\nrelease tarball. You may also want to consult the `pip documentation\n<https://pip.pypa.io/>`_.\n\n\nBackport-specific notes\n-----------------------\n\n* The pythondialog documentation is written for the reference\n  implementation (Python 3 at the time of this writing). To be on the\n  safe side when using the Python 2 backport, you should use Unicode\n  strings every time you pass “string data” to pythondialog, and you\n  will get Unicode strings in return. Indeed, these correspond directly\n  to Python 3 strings, and modern versions of pythondialog (>= 2.12) are\n  all based on this type of string.\n\n  The pythondialog documentation consistently uses the term “string” (as\n  opposed to “Unicode string”) because it has been written for Python 3,\n  but **you should definitely use Unicode strings when using the\n  Python 2 backport**. Many things happen to work with byte strings, but\n  in most cases, this is pure coincidence; others fail, and won't be\n  fixed. This is not a bug.\n\n  The easiest way to use Unicode strings everywhere (or almost\n  everywhere) in Python 2.x with x >= 6, consists in using::\n\n    from __future__ import unicode_literals\n\n  at the beginning of your Python files. This method has the additional\n  benefit of preparing your transition to Python 3.\n\n* Don't use ``str()`` in Python 2 on objects such as pythondialog\n  exceptions or ``dialog.DialogBackendVersion`` instances; use\n  ``unicode()`` instead, which is the Python 2 equivalent of the\n  Python 3 ``str()`` built-in. Of course, using ``repr()`` on any\n  pythondialog object should return a byte string when run under\n  Python 2, because this is how the ``repr()`` API works in Python 2.\n  The same holds true for ``str()``, but this one is not supported by\n  the Python 2 backport of pythondialog: it is superseded, as already\n  explained, by the much more powerful ``unicode()``.\n\n* Before taking potentially expensive decisions, you should realize that\n  Unicode support is *much*, much better in Python 3 than in Python 2,\n  even though the basic types are largely the same (Unicode string in\n  Python 2, native string in Python 3). In Python 3, native strings\n  (simply called “strings” in the Python documentation) are natural and\n  ubiquitous. They can be read and written from/to the standard I/O\n  streams with sane encoding defaults. ``str()`` and ``repr()`` return\n  native strings, as do all standard library calls whenever expected\n  (i.e., when the return value is text, as opposed to binary data).\n  Python 3 strings are both powerful and easy to use.\n\n  By contrast, in Python 2, you always have to be very careful about\n  what you manipulate: byte strings or Unicode strings. Most library\n  calls in your code are a potential source of bug. Usually, this kind\n  of bug only pops up when user data or input introduces non-ASCII\n  characters in a byte string that is then either combined with an\n  Unicode string, or used in a context where the expected encoding is\n  different. This means that some users get annoyed by “crappy”\n  software, while the responsible developers are often not aware of any\n  problem---until a bug report is filed, if ever.\n\n  Want to use ``traceback.format_exc()`` for instance? What does it\n  return, byte string or Unicode string? Experiment. Answer: byte\n  string. Then, how does it deal with, e.g., accented characters in an\n  ``OSError`` exception message? Experiment. Answer: it outputs the\n  ``repr()`` representation of an Unicode string that uses backslash\n  escapes for the non-ASCII characters, all of this inside the returned\n  byte string. Conclusion: the messages seen by users will be very ugly\n  and more or less undecipherable for many of them. Does it behave this\n  way in all cases? Tough question. Use the source, Luke...\n\n  With other library calls, you might get non-ASCII characters in a byte\n  string. Then, the question would be: what encoding has been used to\n  encode them, and is there a reliable way to detect it? In many cases,\n  this is not documented and/or depends on parameters under user\n  control, such as the locale settings. Again, you have to waste time\n  figuring out the encoding, and often can't be sure whether your answer\n  is correct in all cases.\n\n  **Bottom line:**\n\n    There are good reasons why the Python developers broke compatibility\n    at such a fundamental level as string management between Python 2\n    and Python 3. Getting Unicode support completely right in Python 2\n    may require more work than porting your code to Python 3. Besides,\n    future maintainance and evolutions of your program will definitely\n    be easier once it is written in Python 3. Think about it.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\n**Important:** be sure to read the `Backport-specific notes`_ above.\n\nThe pythondialog Manual\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThe pythondialog Manual is written in `reStructuredText`_ format for the\n`Sphinx`_ documentation generator. The HTML documentation for the latest\nversion of pythondialog as rendered by Sphinx should be available at:\n\n  http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/doc/\n\n.. _pythondialog Manual: http://pythondialog.sourceforge.net/doc/\n.. _reStructuredText: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html\n.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/\n.. _LaTeX: https://www.latex-project.org/\n.. _Make: https://www.gnu.org/software/make/\n\nThe sources for the pythondialog Manual are located in the ``doc``\ntop-level directory of the pythondialog distribution, but the\ndocumentation build process pulls many parts from ``dialog.py`` (mainly\ndocstrings).\n\n**Note:**\n\n  Generation of the pythondialog Manual with `Sphinx`_ has only been\n  tested, and is only supported with the reference implementation of\n  pythondialog (i.e., currently, on Python 3). As a consequence, the\n  package containing this file may be fine to read or grep through the\n  ``.rst`` files; however, if compilation of said ``.rst`` files with\n  `Sphinx`_ on Python 2 doesn't work, it is not considered a\n  bug---simply download the reference implementation if you want to do\n  that.\n\nTo generate the documentation yourself from ``dialog.py`` and the\nsources in the ``doc`` directory, first make sure you have `Sphinx`_ and\n`Make`_ installed. Then, you can go to the ``doc`` directory and type,\nfor instance::\n\n  make html\n\nYou will then find the output in the ``_build/html`` subdirectory of\n``doc``. `Sphinx`_ can build the documentation in many other formats.\nFor instance, if you have `LaTeX`_ installed, you can generate the\npythondialog Manual in PDF format using::\n\n  make latexpdf\n\nYou can run ``make`` from the ``doc`` directory to see a list of the\navailable formats. Run ``make clean`` to clean up after the\ndocumentation build process.\n\nFor those who have installed `Sphinx`_ but not `Make`_, it is still\npossible to build the documentation with a command such as::\n\n  sphinx-build -b html . _build/html\n\nrun from the ``doc`` directory. Please refer to `sphinx-build`_ for more\ndetails.\n\n.. _sphinx-build: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html\n\n\nReading the docstrings from an interactive Python interpreter\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIf you have already installed pythondialog, you may consult its\ndocstrings in an interactive Python interpreter this way::\n\n   >>> import dialog; help(dialog)\n\nbut only parts of the documentation are available using this method, and\nthe result is much less convenient to use than the `pythondialog\nManual`_ as generated by `Sphinx`_.\n\n\nEnabling Deprecation Warnings\n-----------------------------\n\nThere are a few places in ``dialog.py`` that send a\n``DeprecationWarning`` to warn developers about obsolete features.\nHowever, because of:\n\n  - the dialog output to the terminal;\n  - the fact that such warnings are silenced by default since Python 2.7\n    and 3.2;\n\nyou have to do two things in order to see them:\n\n  - redirect the standard error stream to a file;\n  - enable the warnings for the Python interpreter.\n\nFor instance, to see the warnings produced when running the demo, you\ncan do::\n\n  PYTHONPATH=. python2 -Wd examples/demo.py 2>/path/to/file\n\nand examine ``/path/to/file``. This can also help you to find files that\nare still open when your program exits.\n\n**Note:**\n\n  If your program is terminated by an unhandled exception while stderr\n  is redirected as in the preceding command, you won't see the traceback\n  until you examine the file stderr was redirected to. This can be\n  disturbing, as your program may exit with no apparent reason in such\n  conditions.\n\nFor more explanations and other methods to enable deprecation warnings,\nplease refer to:\n\n  https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/2.7.html\n\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\nIf you have a problem with a pythondialog call, you should read its\ndocumentation and the dialog(1) manual page. If this is not enough, you\ncan enable logging of shell command-line equivalents of all dialog calls\nmade by your program with a simple call to ``Dialog.setup_debug()``,\nfirst available in pythondialog 2.12 (the ``expand_file_opt`` parameter\nmay be useful in versions 3.3 and later). An example of this can be\nfound in ``demo.py`` from the ``examples`` directory.\n\nAs of version 2.12, you can also enable this debugging facility for\n``demo.py`` by calling it with the ``--debug`` flag (possibly combined\nwith ``--debug-expand-file-opt`` in pythondialog 3.3 and later, cf.\n``demo.py --help``).\n\n\nUsing Xdialog instead of dialog\n-------------------------------\n\nAs far as I can tell, `Xdialog`_ has not been ported to `GTK+`_ version\n2 or later. It is not in `Debian`_ stable nor unstable (November 30, 2019).\nIt is not installed on my system (because of the GTK+ 1.2 dependency),\nand according to the Xdialog-specific patches I received from Peter\nÅstrand in 2004, was not a drop-in replacement for `dialog`_ (in\nparticular, Xdialog seemed to want to talk to the caller through stdout\ninstead of stderr, grrrrr!).\n\n.. _Xdialog: http://xdialog.free.fr/\n.. _GTK+: https://www.gtk.org/\n.. _Debian: https://www.debian.org/\n\nAll this to say that, even though I didn't remove the options to use\nanother backend than dialog, nor did I remove the handful of little,\nnon-invasive modifications that help pythondialog work better with\n`Xdialog`_, I don't really support the latter. I test everything with\ndialog, and nothing with Xdialog.\n\nThat being said, here is the *old* text of this section (from 2004), in\ncase you are still interested:\n\n  Starting with 2.06, there is an \"Xdialog\" compatibility mode that you\n  can use if you want pythondialog to run the graphical Xdialog program\n  (which *should* be found under http://xdialog.free.fr/) instead of\n  dialog (text-mode, based on the ncurses library).\n\n  The primary supported platform is still dialog, but as long as only\n  small modifications are enough to make pythondialog work with Xdialog,\n  I am willing to support Xdialog if people are interested in it (which\n  turned out to be the case for Xdialog).\n\n  The demo.py from pythondialog 2.06 has been tested with Xdialog 2.0.6\n  and found to work well (barring Xdialog's annoying behaviour with the\n  file selection dialog box).\n\n\nWhiptail, anyone?\n-----------------\n\nWell, pythondialog seems not to work very well with whiptail. The reason\nis that whiptail is not compatible with dialog anymore. Although you can\ntell pythondialog the program you want it to invoke, only programs that\nare mostly dialog-compatible are supported.\n\n\nHistory\n-------\n\npythondialog was originally written by Robb Shecter. Sultanbek Tezadov\nadded some features to it (mainly the first gauge implementation, I\nguess). Florent Rougon rewrote most parts of the program to make it more\nrobust and flexible so that it can give access to most features of the\ndialog program. Peter Åstrand took over maintainership between 2004 and\n2009, with particular care for the `Xdialog`_ support. Florent Rougon\ntook over maintainership again starting from 2009...\n\n.. \n  # Local Variables:\n  # coding: utf-8\n  # fill-column: 72\n  #
