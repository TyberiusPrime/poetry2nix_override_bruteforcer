These non-Silva or external sources can for\nexample be a relational database or the outcome of executing a Python\nscript.\n\nSince an external source can potentially be resource intensive or a\nexpose a vulnerability, only users with ZMI access (usualy site\nmanagers) can create external sources. It is their responsibilty to\nmake sure no vunerabilities are exposed to the Authors.\n\nAn external source object can expose - using a Formulator form - a set\nof parameters to the Author of a Silva Document. The actual use of\nthese parameters (and the values set by the Author) is to be specified\nby the external source implementation.\n\nBy implementing the IExternalSource interface, one can create new types\nof external sources. See ``interfaces.py`` for more details on this.\n\nThe SilvaExternalSources extension currently implements three\nexternal sources: *Silva Code Source*, *Silva SQL Source* and\n*Silva CSV Source*.  The latter is special in that it also shows\nup as an asset in Silva. This is possible because no code is\ncontained in a CSVSource.\n\nCode repository\n===============\n\nYou can find the code of this extension in Git:\nhttps://github.com/silvacms/Products.SilvaExternalSources\n\n.. _Silva: http://silvacms.org\n\nChangeLog\n=========\n\n3.0.3 (2013/12/18)\n------------------\n\n- Add two screens in SMI in order to install and update code sources\n  in the Silva site.\n\n- Improve error handling while installing and updating code sources.\n\n- Make the button export as zip usuable on code sources which doesn't\n  have a location.\n\n- Improve cs_iframe and remove cs_java_plugin.\n\n3.0.2 (2013/10/09)\n------------------\n\n- Add a twitter code source.\n\n- Add the cs_copyright code source, that is the example created in the\n  `Silva technical documentation <http://docs.silvacms.org/latest/code_source/index.html>`_\n\n- Improve CKEditor plugin to work better in non-Firefox browsers.\n\n- A new field only accessible to manager let them warp the HTML\n  generated by a source with custom HTML code.\n\n- Add various helpers function accessible to code source in order to\n  expose Silva API.\n\n- Add a feature to dump code sources modified in ZODB back to the\n  filesystem.\n\n- Add a feature to dump all code sources to the filesystem, even if\n  they don't exists there yet (``manage_export_codesources``).\n\n- Improve code source service in order to be able to manage large\n  amount of code sources.\n\n- Add and improves more tests.\n\n3.0.1 (2013/05/24)\n------------------\n\n- Support broken and missing sources in the Source Asset content.\n\n- Fix import of broken and missing sources in the Source Asset\n  content.\n\n- Add support to export code sources to the file system.\n\n- Add support to tab between code source fields in CKEditor.\n\n- Improve tests.\n\n3.0 (2013/03/06)\n----------------\n\n- Update Silva XML import and export API.\n\n- Update cs_encaptionate and portlet_element code sources.\n\n- Improve import of inexisting code sources.\n\n3.0c1 (2012/09/25)\n------------------\n\n- Refactor code source API for Silva 3.0c1.\n\n- Update to Silva 3.0c1 API.\n\n- Update default code sources for Silva 3.0.\n\n- Add new content type *Source Asset*.\n\n- Improve Code Source service.\n\n- Improve tests.\n\n- Fix bugs.\n\n3.0b1 (2011/11/11)\n------------------\n\n- Add support to edit and save sources within CKEditor with\n  ``silva.core.editor``.\n\n- Update code source installation from the service to be less painfull\n  on upgrade.\n\n- Add support to update a code source from its filesystem definition.\n\n- Add a screen on the code source to locate all usuable code source\n  within a Silva site.\n\n- Remove Kupu support.\n\n- Update code sources to work with Silva 3.0.\n\n- Update code to work with Zope 2.13.\n\n2.3.1 (2010/10/18)\n------------------\n\n- Update CVSSource to properly work in Silva 2.3.\n\n- Fix broken packaged code sources in Silva 2.3.\n\n2.3 (2010/07/16)\n----------------\n\n- Code sources have now proper access to ``model`` and ``version`` they\n  are rendered one.\n\n- Clean some CSS style on some sources.\n\n- Improve installation code.\n\n- Clean some unused code.\n\n- Update to work with last Silva Document.\n\n- Compatiblity fixes for Zope 2.12.\n\n2.2b1 (2010/02/01)\n------------------\n\nBugs fixed\n~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- fix for codesources to keep the .js extension in the id of a\n  javascript resource\n\n\nFeatures Added\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n- Support DateTimeFields as parameters\n\n- update cs_toc\n\n- an 'is previewable in kupu' setting was added to external\n  sources.
