Furthermore, the \"parent\" site can access and view the content in all the \"child\" sites while the child sites only view their own content.\nThe parent site can also syndicate chosen content to the selected child sites.\nLineage is less complex and easier to manage than a cluster of nested Plone sites but gives users all the same benefits.\n\nLineage can be used within a large organization to manage multiple microsites, such as school district sites, university departments, corporate product sites, public library satellites, professional association events, and more.\n\n\nVersion information\n===================\n\n- 3.x: Plone 5.2, 6.0 - Python 3.8+\n- 2.x: Plone 5.0, 5.1, 5.2 - Python 2.7\n- 1.x: Plone 4.3\n\n\nUseful links\n============\n\n.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/collective/collective.lineage.svg?branch=master\n    :target: https://travis-ci.org/collective/collective.lineage\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/collective/collective.lineage/badge.svg?branch=master&service=github\n    :target: https://coveralls.io/github/collective/collective.lineage?branch=master\n\n- pypi: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.lineage\n- Plone: http://plone.org/products/collective-lineage\n- issue tracker: https://github.com/collective/collective.lineage/issues/\n- code repository: http://github.com/collective/collective.lineage/\n\n\nDetailed Documentation\n======================\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nBootstrapped your buildout with all the dependencies.\nInstall Lineage via ``Site Setup -> Add on Products``.\nNow you are ready to go.\n\nAdd a Child Site:\n\n1. In Plone, go to the place where you want to add a new child site.\n2. Click Add New, and add a `Folder`.\n3. Enter the title and description for the Child site.\n4. Click Save.\n5. Click the `Actions` drop down and select `Enable Subsite`.\n   This \"activates\" the child site behavior.\n6. The Plone site now has a child site.\n   A drop down will appear at the top of the Plone to the left of the site actions area.\n   A user can select the parent site or any child sites from this drop down.\n\n\nLineage extensions\n------------------\n\nThere is a bunch of extensions available.\nThey are helpful when there is the need of more special features within subites.\n\n`lineage.index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lineage.index>`_\n    Adds an index and metadata that allows to search for content of a specific childsite only\n\n`collective.rooter <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/collective.rooter>`_\n    Force catalog queries to obey the current subsite\n\n`lineage.registry <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lineage.registry>`_\n    Provides a plone.app.registry for Lineage subsites.\n    It adds a local component with a layered-/proxy-registry\n\n`lineage.themeselection <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lineage.themeselection>`_\n    Provides custom theme selection for Lineage subsites.\n\nFor more search Pypi\n\nUpgrading to 2.X\n----------------\n\nLineage `2.0` is a major upgrade to the software and will require you to have\nupdated to the `1.1.2` version before you migrate any existing Lineage child\nsites to the new version. Lineage `2.0` removes all dependencies on\n`p4a.subtyper` and makes the product Plone 5 ready. The `1.1.2` release of\nLineage is only used to migrate your existing Lineage `1.1` sites up to the\nneeded state for the new `2.0` release.\n\nSteps for upgrading:\n\n1. Install version `1.1.2` into your existing Lineage powered site\n2. Go to the Plone Site Setup and from the Add-Ons panel click the button to\n   upgrade the Lineage product\n3. Install version `2.0` into your existing Lineage powered site\n4. Go to the Plone Site Setup and from the Add-Ons panel click the button to\n   upgrade the Lineage product\n5. Enjoy Lineage `2.0`\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n3.0.0 (2023-11-20)\n------------------\n\n- Drop Python 2.7 support and code cleanup.\n  [petschki, thet]\n\n\n2.3.1 (2023-11-20)\n------------------\n\n- Add support for Plone 6 while keeping Plone 5 compatibility.\n  [petschki, thet]\n\n\n2.3 (2020-02-16)\n----------------\n\n- Add support for Python 3\n  [cillianderoiste]\n\n- Fixed for Plone 5.2\n  [ajung]\n\n- Fix broken image link in README, fix project URL in setup.py\n  [tkimnguyen]\n\n- Remove extraneous code that was causing a len() deprecation warning, #58\n  [tkimnguyen]\n\n- require plone.dexterity >= 2.9.3 for Python 3 (#55)\n  [petri,tkimnguyen]\n\n- use pyflakes 2.1.0 to fix tests\n  [tkimnguyen]\n\n2.2 (2019-01-02)\n----------------\n\n- Load the image traverser only if plone.app.imaging is installed.\n  [thet]\n\n- Support registering browser layers for child sites for per-child-site theming.\n  [rpatterson]\n\n- Simplify travis configuration and fix travis test run.\n  [thet]\n\n- Depend on ``Products.CMFPlone`` instead of ``Plone`` to not fetch unnecessary dependencies.\n  [thet]\n\n- Add descriptors.py back in with a placeholder so the site doesn't complain about it missing.\n  [abosio]\n\n\n2.1 (2016-10-03)\n----------------\n\n- Implement new utility method ``parent_site``.\n  [thet]\n\n- Setup related cleanups.\n  [thet]\n\n- fix ``IImagingSchema`` traverser for Plone 4, disable in Plone 5\n  [jensens]\n\n- basic tests for enable/disable childsite\n  [jensens]\n\n- household chores: make flake-8 happy (utf8-headers), some other minor pep8,\n  add travis configuration and let tests run against 4.1 to 5.0 (and fixed\n  them).\n  [jensens]\n\n- Include ``get_image_traverser`` only when\n  ``plone.app.imaging.interfaces.IImagingSchema`` is available, which is not\n  the case in Plone 5.\n  [thet]\n\n- Peel out ``enable_childsite`` and ``disable_childsite`` from the\n  ``lineage_tool`` view, so that it can be easily used programmatically.\n  [thet]\n\n- We don't want to enable or disable a childsite on a default page.
