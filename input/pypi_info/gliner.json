Here’s how you can incorporate those instructions:\n\n---\n\n## 🛠 Installation & Usage\n\nTo begin using the GLiNER model, you can install the GLiNER Python library through pip, conda, or directly from the source.\n\n### Install via Pip\n\n```bash\n!pip install gliner\n```\n\n### Install via Conda\n\n```bash\nconda install -c conda-forge gliner\n```\n\n### Install from Source\n\nTo install the GLiNER library from source, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Clone the Repository:**\n\n   First, clone the GLiNER repository from GitHub:\n\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/urchade/GLiNER\n   ```\n\n2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**\n\n   Change to the directory containing the cloned repository:\n\n   ```bash\n   cd GLiNER\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Dependencies:**\n\n   It's a good practice to create and activate a virtual environment before installing dependencies:\n\n   ```bash\n   python -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n   ```\n\n   Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n4. **Install the GLiNER Package:**\n\n   Finally, install the GLiNER package using the setup script:\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install .\n   ```\n\n5. **Verify Installation:**\n\n   You can verify the installation by importing the library in a Python script:\n\n   ```python\n   import gliner\n   print(gliner.__version__)\n   ```\n---\n\n### 🚀 Basic Use Case\n\nAfter the installation of the GLiNER library, import the `GLiNER` class. Following this, you can load your chosen model with `GLiNER.from_pretrained` and utilize `predict_entities` to discern entities within your text.\n\n```python\nfrom gliner import GLiNER\n\n# Initialize GLiNER with the base model\nmodel = GLiNER.from_pretrained(\"urchade/gliner_mediumv2.1\")\n\n# Sample text for entity prediction\ntext = \"\"\"\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro (Portuguese pronunciation: [kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu]; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for and captains both Saudi Pro League club Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five Ballon d'Or awards,[note 3] a record three UEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards, and four European Golden Shoes, the most by a European player. He has won 33 trophies in his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions Leagues, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances (183), goals (140) and assists (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), international goals (128) and international appearances (205). He is one of the few players to have made over 1,200 professional career appearances, the most by an outfield player, and has scored over 850 official senior career goals for club and country, making him the top goalscorer of all time.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Labels for entity prediction\nlabels = [\"Person\", \"Award\", \"Date\", \"Competitions\", \"Teams\"]\n\n# Perform entity prediction\nentities = model.predict_entities(text, labels, threshold=0.5)\n\n# Display predicted entities and their labels\nfor entity in entities:\n    print(entity[\"text\"], \"=>\", entity[\"label\"])\n```\n\n#### Expected Output\n\n```\nCristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro => person\n5 February 1985 => date\nAl Nassr => teams\nPortugal national team => teams\nBallon d'Or => award\nUEFA Men's Player of the Year Awards => award\nEuropean Golden Shoes => award\nUEFA Champions Leagues => competitions\nUEFA European Championship => competitions\nUEFA Nations League => competitions\nEuropean Championship => competitions\n```\n\n### 🔌 Usage with spaCy\n\nGLiNER can be seamlessly integrated with spaCy. To begin, install the `gliner-spacy` library via pip:\n\n```bash\npip install gliner-spacy\n```\n\nFollowing installation, you can add GLiNER to a spaCy NLP pipeline. Here's how to integrate it with a blank English pipeline; however, it's compatible with any spaCy model.\n\n```python\nimport spacy\nfrom gliner_spacy.pipeline import GlinerSpacy\n\n# Configuration for GLiNER integration\ncustom_spacy_config = {\n    \"gliner_model\": \"urchade/gliner_mediumv2.1\",\n    \"chunk_size\": 250,\n    \"labels\": [\"person\", \"organization\", \"email\"],\n    \"style\": \"ent\",\n    \"threshold\": 0.3,\n    \"map_location\": \"cpu\" # only available in v.0.0.7\n}\n\n# Initialize a blank English spaCy pipeline and add GLiNER\nnlp = spacy.blank(\"en\")\nnlp.add_pipe(\"gliner_spacy\", config=custom_spacy_config)\n\n# Example text for entity detection\ntext = \"This is a text about Bill Gates and Microsoft.\"\n\n# Process the text with the pipeline\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Output detected entities\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    print(ent.text, ent.label_, ent._.score) # ent._.score only available in v. 0.0.7\n```\n\n#### Expected Output\n\n```\nBill Gates => person\nMicrosoft => organization\n```\n\n##  📊 NER Benchmark Results\n\n<img align=\"center\" src=\"https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6317233cc92fd6fee317e030/Y5f7tK8lonGqeeO6L6bVI.png\" />\n\n## ONNX convertion:\nTo convert previously trained GLiNER models to ONNX format, you can use the `convert_to_onnx.py` script. You need to provide the `model_path` and `save_path` arguments to specify the location of the model and where to save the ONNX file, respectively. Additionally, if you wish to quantize the model, set the `quantize` argument to True (it quantizes to *IntU8* by default).\n\nExample usage:\n\n```bash\n\npython convert_to_onnx.py --model_path /path/to/your/model --save_path /path/to/save/onnx --quantize True\n```\n\nTo load the converted ONNX models, you can use the following code snippet:\n\n```python\n\nfrom gliner import GLiNER\n\nmodel = GLiNER.from_pretrained(\"path_to_your_model\", load_onnx_model=True, load_tokenizer=True)\n\n```\nThe `load_onnx_model` argument ensures that the GLiNER class recognizes that it should load the ONNX model instead of a PyTorch model.\nSetting the `load_tokenizer`` argument to True loads the tokenizer from your model directory, including any additional tokens that were added during training.\n\n## 🛠 Areas of Improvements / research\n\n- [ ] Extend the model to relation extraction. Our preliminary work [GraphER](https://github.com/urchade/GraphER).\n- [ ] Allow longer context (eg. train with long context transformers such as Longformer, LED, etc.)\n- [ ] Use Bi-encoder (entity encoder and span encoder) allowing precompute entity embeddings\n- [ ] Filtering mechanism to reduce number of spans before final classification to save memory and computation when the number entity types is large\n- [ ] Improve understanding of more detailed prompts/instruction, eg. \"Find the first name of the person in the text\"\n- [ ] Better loss function: for instance use ```Focal Loss``` (see [this paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/aeb7b30ef1d024a76f21a1d40e30c302-Paper.pdf)) instead of ```BCE``` to handle class imbalance, as some entity types are more frequent than others\n- [ ] Improve multi-lingual capabilities: train on more languages, and use multi-lingual training data\n- [ ] Decoding: allow a span to have multiple labels, eg: \"Cristiano Ronaldo\" is both a \"person\" and \"football player\"\n- [ ] Dynamic thresholding (in ```model.predict_entities(text, labels, threshold=0.5)```): allow the model to predict more entities, or less entities, depending on the context. Actually, the model tend to predict less entities where the entity type or the domain are not well represented in the training data.\n- [ ] Train with EMAs (Exponential Moving Averages) or merge multiple checkpoints to improve model robustness (see [this paper](https://openreview.net/forum?id=tq_J_MqB3UB))\n\n\n## 👨‍💻 Model Authors\nThe model authors are:\n* [Urchade Zaratiana](https://huggingface.co/urchade)\n* Nadi Tomeh\n* Pierre Holat\n* Thierry Charnois\n\n## 📚 Citation\n\nIf you find GLiNER useful in your research, please consider citing our paper:\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{zaratiana2023gliner,\n      title={GLiNER: Generalist Model for Named Entity Recognition using Bidirectional Transformer}, \n      author={Urchade Zaratiana and Nadi Tomeh and Pierre Holat and Thierry Charnois},\n      year={2023},\n      eprint={2311.08526},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.CL}\n}\n```\n## Support and funding\n\nThis project has been supported and funded by **FI Group** and **Laboratoire Informatique de Paris Nord**.\n\nOver the past 20 years, [FI Group](https://fr.fi-group.com) has become a specialist in public funding strategies for R&D&I² (Research and Development, Innovation and Investment).
