It runs two webservers: one serves HVAC\n`/metrics` in a format that can be queried by\n[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), a time series database.\nPrometheus is a backend for [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)\nvisualizations/dashboards.\n\nThe other webserver is optional. It stores all the WRITE and ACK06\nframes seen on the ABCD bus and dumps them as JSON. The functions in\n`analysis.py` can then be used to help find meaning in the frames.\n\n## Why?\n\nAn HVAC system consumes a lot of energy. You might want to know how\nhard it's working, how often it's running, whether it's running when\nyour windows are open...\n\nCarrier's apps are crappy and they no longer even have a functioning\nwebapp. Plus it's nice to be able to monitor your equipment without\nrelying on connectivity to Carrier's servers.\n\nCarrier's SAM module provides significant information about the modes\nof the system. But it does not report the state of the system: when\nheating and cooling are actually operating, the current fan speed,\nthe zones to which the dampers are directing airflow, etc.\n\n## How?\n\nTo start with, you'll need an RS-485 adapter that can attach to the\nwires of Carrier's ABCD bus. If you have a Raspberry Pi or some other\ncomputer near one of the Carrier devices, you can use a [USB RS-485\nadapter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08SM5MX8K). If you don't\nhave a nearby computer but you do have Ethernet near one of the\nCarrier devices, you can use an [Ethernet RS-485\nbridge](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C1TC165).\n\nYou can install finitude from PyPI using pip:\n```\npip install finitude\n```\n\nSoon you'll be able to install an image from Docker Hub. But not yet.\n\n## Based On\n\n* [https://github.com/3tones/brybus](brybus) -- This is unmaintained\nsince 2014, but it's simple so that's where I started.\n\n* [https://github.com/nebulous/infinitude](infinitude) -- This doesn't\nfocus on RS-485; instead it proxies the thermostat's network traffic\nto/from Carrier's servers and intercepts/modifies the data stream. It\nalso has an RS-485 parser as a sidelight.  If it weren't written in\nPerl I might have started there. Props to nebulous for continuing to\nsupport this.\n\n* [https://github.com/acd/infinitive](infinitive) -- This is\nunmaintained since 2018, but the Go code is clear and there is still\nan active user community. It does focus on RS-485. It doesn't support\nmulti-zone systems and some of its info fields are only populated\nby legacy heat pumps.\n\n\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/dulitz/finitude","keywords":"","license":"","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"finitude","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/finitude/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/finitude/","project_urls":{"Bug
