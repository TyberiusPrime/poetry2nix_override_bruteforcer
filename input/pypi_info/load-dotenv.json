There are different ways\nto do this, for example handy [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/)\npackage. But it should be executed explicitly in order to work. In my projects\nI don't want to add `load_dotenv()` execution in my code that is running on\nproduction, and I'm too lazy to create customer runners for development only.\nThus, I made **load-dotenv** that can do this for me automatically.\n\n## Installation\n```shell\npip install load-dotenv\n```\n\n## Usage\nCreate `.env` file in your working directory and put your variables there.\nFor details about file format, please refer\n[python-dotenv documentation](https://saurabh-kumar.com/python-dotenv/#file-format).\nRun your application with `LOAD_DOTENV` variable set to one of `true`, `yes` or `1`.\n\nAlternative path to the file can be specified via `LOAD_DOTENV_PATH` variable.\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/fly/load-dotenv","keywords":"environment variables,env,.env,dotenv","license":"","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"load-dotenv","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/load-dotenv/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/load-dotenv/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://github.com/fly/load-dotenv","Source":"https://github.com/fly/load-dotenv","Tracker":"https://github.com/fly/load-dotenv/issues"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/load-dotenv/0.1.0/","requires_dist":["python-dotenv"],"requires_python":"","summary":"Automatically and implicitly load environment variables from .env file","version":"0.1.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":14977908,"releases":{"0.1.0":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"142e268a528dfa1f76999435634b0453fdd917ea878a818a6d5981632f7acffb","md5":"82a74d3f7b8fb2b339ccfa9c68d5c4bc","sha256":"614803f720153fb8a5f97124a72aaa3930a67aa5547cbe8603d01ea7f9ac1adf"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"load_dotenv-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"82a74d3f7b8fb2b339ccfa9c68d5c4bc","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":null,"size":7175,"upload_time":"2022-09-02T19:54:59","upload_time_iso_8601":"2022-09-02T19:54:59.850596Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/14/2e/268a528dfa1f76999435634b0453fdd917ea878a818a6d5981632f7acffb/load_dotenv-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"d795055d123dde74bd54b99b27a3c2d8c6e218f544e0bd437480f61ccf85a07f","md5":"b696a75772905e4601dc89a548f5f08d","sha256":"bbe5f40072d4a61eadca66de6c222df5a2d935d6d41b703be1ff75396f635145"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"load-dotenv-0.1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"b696a75772905e4601dc89a548f5f08d","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":6404,"upload_time":"2022-09-02T19:55:01","upload_time_iso_8601":"2022-09-02T19:55:01.349583Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d7/95/055d123dde74bd54b99b27a3c2d8c6e218f544e0bd437480f61ccf85a07f/load-dotenv-0.1.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"142e268a528dfa1f76999435634b0453fdd917ea878a818a6d5981632f7acffb","md5":"82a74d3f7b8fb2b339ccfa9c68d5c4bc","sha256":"614803f720153fb8a5f97124a72aaa3930a67aa5547cbe8603d01ea7f9ac1adf"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"load_dotenv-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"82a74d3f7b8fb2b339ccfa9c68d5c4bc","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":null,"size":7175,"upload_time":"2022-09-02T19:54:59","upload_time_iso_8601":"2022-09-02T19:54:59.850596Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/14/2e/268a528dfa1f76999435634b0453fdd917ea878a818a6d5981632f7acffb/load_dotenv-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"d795055d123dde74bd54b99b27a3c2d8c6e218f544e0bd437480f61ccf85a07f","md5":"b696a75772905e4601dc89a548f5f08d","sha256":"bbe5f40072d4a61eadca66de6c222df5a2d935d6d41b703be1ff75396f635145"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"load-dotenv-0.1.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"b696a75772905e4601dc89a548f5f08d","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":6404,"upload_time":"2022-09-02T19:55:01","upload_time_iso_8601":"2022-09-02T19:55:01.349583Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d7/95/055d123dde74bd54b99b27a3c2d8c6e218f544e0bd437480f61ccf85a07f/load-dotenv-0.1.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
