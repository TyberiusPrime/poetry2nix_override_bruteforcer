Worth to mention that the\nfollowing tips are strongly recommended before proceeding with the upgrade:\n\n- Do a zeopack\n- Do a backup of both your code and database\n- Try to have as much analyses in verified/published statuses as possible\n- Stop unnecessary applications and services that may consume RAM\n- Start with a clean log file\n\n\nUpdate from 1.2.9 to 1.3.0\n--------------------------\n\n**IMPORTANT: Plan the upgrade with enough time**\n\nVersion 1.3.0 is not a hotfix release, it rather comes with a lot of changes\nthat require additional care when planning the update. If you have your own\nadd-on, please review the changes to check beforehand if some parts of your\nadd-on require modifications.\n\nThis update will take long (up to 5h for instances with large amounts of data).\nTherefore, is recommended to plan and allocate enough resources for the process\nto complete beforehand. For big databases, RAM is a critical factor to be\nconsidered before upgrading. Worth to mention that the following tips are\nstrongly recommended before proceeding with the upgrade:\n\n- Do a zeopack\n- Do a backup of both your code and database\n- Try to have as much analyses in verified/published statuses as possible\n- Stop unnecessary applications and services that may consume RAM\n- Start with a clean log file\n\nMost of the base code has been refactored keeping in mind the following\nobjectives:\n\n- Less complexity: less code, better code\n- High test coverage: lower chance of undetected bugs\n- Boost performance: better experience, with no delays\n- Improve security: rely on Zope's security policies\n- Code responsibility: focus on core functionalities and let other add-ons to\n  deal with the rest (`senaite.lims`, `senaite.core.listing`, etc.)\n\nBesides of this refactoring, this version also comes with a myriad of new\nfunctionalities and enhancements: full-fledged sample partitions, reinvented\nlistings and results entry, new adapters for extensibility, etc.\n\nVersion 1.3 is the result of hard, but exciting work at same time. Four months\nof walking through valleys of tears and fighting hydras. Four exciting months to\nbe proud of.\n\n\nUpdate from 1.2.8 to 1.2.9\n--------------------------\n\n**IMPORTANT: Plan the upgrade with enough time**\nThis update might take long depending on the number of Analyses, Analysis\nRequests and Samples registered in the system:\n\n- Role mappings updated for Analaysis Requests and Samples (rejection)\n  https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core/pull/1041\n\n- Recatalog of invalidated/retest Analysis Requests (invalidation)\n  https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core/pull/1027\n\n- Reindex and recatalog of getDueDate for Analysis Requests\n  https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core/pull/1051\n\n- Reindex of getDueDate for Analyses:\n  https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core/pull/1032\n\n- Workflow: `retract_ar` transition has been renamed to `invalidate`\n  https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core/pull/1027\n\n\nUpdate from 1.2.7 to 1.2.8\n--------------------------\n\n- Operators for min and max values have been added. For specifications already\n  present in the system, the result ranges are considered as bounded and closed:\n  `[min,max] = {result | min <= result <= max}`.\n  https://github.com/senaite/senaite.core/pull/965\n\n\nUpdate from 1.2.4 to 1.2.5\n--------------------------\n\n- This update requires the execution of `bin/buildout`, because\n  Products.TextIndexNG3 has been added. It will help to search by wildcards in\n  TextIndexNG3 indexes instead of looking for the keyword inside wildcards.\n  For now, it is used only in AR listing catalog.\n  https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Products.TextIndexNG3/\n\n- This update might take long depending on the number of Analyses registered in\n  the system, because the upgrade step will walk through all analyses in order\n  to update those that do not have a valid (non-floatable) duplicate variation\n  value (see #768).\n\n\nUpdate from 1.2.3 to 1.2.4\n--------------------------\n\n- This update requires the execution of `bin/buildout`, because WeasyPrint has\n  been updated to version 0.42.2:\n  http://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#version-0-42-2\n\n\nUpdate from 1.2.2 to 1.2.3\n--------------------------\n\n- IMPORTANT: Plan the upgrade with enough time\n  This update might take long depending on the number of Analysis Requests\n  registered in the system because a new index and column 'assigned_state' has\n  been added in Analysis Requests catalog, that require the catalog to be\n  reindexed (see #637).\n\n\nUpdate from 1.2.1 to 1.2.2\n--------------------------\n\n- IMPORTANT: Plan the upgrade with enough time\n  This update might take long depending on the number of Batches registered in\n  the system, because an index from their catalog needs to be reindexed (#574).\n  Also, a new index that affects the Worksheets that have a Worksheet Template\n  assigned has been added and needs to be indexed.\n\n\nUpdate from 1.2.0 to 1.2.1\n--------------------------\n\n- This update requires the execution of `bin/buildout`, because a new dependency has\n  been added: `Plone Subrequest <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/plone.subrequest/>`_\n\n- With this update, Analyses Services that are inactive, but have active\n  dependent services, will be automatically transitioned to `active` state. This\n  procedure fixes eventual inconsistencies amongst the statuses of Analyses\n  Services. See #555\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.3.5 (unreleased)\n------------------\n\n**Fixed**\n\n- #1673 Fix Samples not sorted in natural order when Worksheet Template is used\n- #1656 Fix Maximum length
