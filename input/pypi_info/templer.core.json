Included are a base template class, utility scripts, the templer\ncommand-line wrapper and basic templates for basic python namespace packages and\nnested namespace packages.\n\nAll functionality of the templer system is inherited from and extends \nPasteScript_ templates.  Templates can be generated using the syntax of that\npackage, but the templer system provides a wrapper script to make it easier\nfor developers to generate packages.\n\n.. _PasteScript: http://pythonpaste.org/script/\n\ntempler script\n--------------\n\nThis package provides a script, ``templer``. The script acts as a wrapper for\nPasteScript's ``paster create``, hiding the newbie-error-prone syntax of that\ncommand. The ``templer`` script also provides some inline error-checking for\nproject names and other variables as well as additional help. It is recommended\nto use this script--especially for new users--rather than using ``paster\ncreate`` directly. (The resulting packages produced, however, will be the same).\n\nFor example, to create a new basic namespace package invoke the script like so::\n\n    templer basic_namespace \n\nThis will prompt you to provide a name for your package.  The name you provide \nwill be validated to ensure that it fits with the number of namespaces expected \nby the template you have chosen.\n\nOnce you have set the name for your new package, You will be asked to choose a \nset of questions to answer.  By default, only the 'easy' questions are selected, \nallowing you to create a new package with a minimum of interaction.  However, \nyou may choose the ``expert`` set, or even choose to answer ``all`` questions \nif you need more control over the final output of your package.\n\nAt any time in the question-and-answer process, you may type a ``?`` at the \nprompt to recieve in-line assistance with the current question.\n\nIf you wish to quit the process at any time during the questions, simply enter\n``q`` at the prompt.\n\nAdditional Script Functions\n---------------------------\n\nIn addition to interactively generating code, the templer script provides a \nnumber of other useful functions:\n\n    ``templer --help``\n      provides full listings of the help text for the templer script.\n\n    ``templer --list``\n      provides a detailed list of the available templates\n    \n    ``templer --version``\n      provides the version number of the currently installed templer package\n\nTesting\n=======\n\nThis package provides both unit tests for code functions and doctests for each \nof the provided templates.  If you make changes to the package, you must ensure \nthat these tests run successfully before checking them in.  Please also \ncontribute tests for any code you create.  To run the tests, execute the \nfollowing::\n\n    $ python setup.py test\n\n\nContributors\n============\n\n- Cris Ewing, original author\n- Lazaro Clapp\n- Hector Velarde\n\nBased on code from zopeskel, contributors to which include:\n\n- Daniel Nouri\n- Tarek Ziad√©\n- Mustapha Benali\n- Sylvain Viollon\n- Alan Hoey\n- Josh Johnson\n- Emanuel Sartor\n- Matthew Wilkes\n- Joel Burton\n- Cris Ewing\n- Chris Calloway\n- Chris Rossi\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n1.0b4 May 17, 2012\n------------------\n\n- Refactored test setup code for better sharing across packages\n  [cewing]\n\n- Fixed bug in test setup exposed by mixing doc and non-doc tests using\n  os.getcwd()\n  [cewing]\n\n- Fix packaging problems and normalize setup.py\n  [hvelarde]\n\n- Convert to unittest2 and remove deprecated test assertion aliases\n  [hvelarde]\n\n- Restore support for localcommands as were present in ZopeSkel.  Improve\n  localcommands by making them optional\n  [cewing]\n\n- Provide exit so you can bail from a template run cleanly.  Improve exit \n  conditions throughout the templer script\n  [cewing]\n\n- Fixed long-standing bug in tests that showed subpackages failing when they\n  in fact succeeded\n  [Lazaro Clapp]\n\n- Factor structures code into a separate method so we can use it in vars, too\n  [cewing]\n\n1.0b3 October 6, 2011\n---------------------\n\n- relicense as MIT to keep in sync with ZopeSkel as its internals are replaced\n  [cewing]\n\n1.0b2 December 8, 2010\n----------------------\n\n- Fixed bug in structure system that broke template rendering when a template \n  had no license \n  [Cris Ewing]\n\n- Moved zc.buildout template recipe into new package templer.buildout\n  [Cris Ewing]\n\n- Improved consistency of how templates treat 'long_description' in setup.py\n  [Cris Ewing]\n\n- Fixed documentation references to the zopeskel script (we will call the script\n  'templer' when used from the templer packages.)\n  [Cris Ewing]\n\n1.0b1 December 1, 2010\n----------------------\n\n- Added structure system for better isolation of shared structural elements and\n  improved maintainability\n  [Cris Ewing]\n\n- Namespace for package changed to 'templer' to promote use by systems outside \n  the Zope world\n  [Cris Ewing]\n\n- Ported basic_namespace, nested_namespace and recipe templates over from \n  zopeskel package to create core of new templer system (see\n  http://svn.plone.org/svn/collective/ZopeSkel/branches/2.x-maintenance/SPLITTING-PROPOSAL.txt\n  for the rationale behind this move)\n  [Cris Ewing]\n\n- Package created by ZopeSkel\n  [Cris
