In particular, these rules are often used for\nevaluating weather forecasts.\n\n.. _Proper scoring rules: https://www.stat.washington.edu/raftery/Research/PDF/Gneiting2007jasa.pdf\n\nproperscoring runs on both Python 2 and 3. It requires NumPy (1.8 or\nlater) and SciPy (any recent version should be fine). Numba is optional,\nbut highly encouraged: it enables significant speedups (e.g., 20x faster)\nfor ``crps_ensemble`` and ``threshold_brier_score``.\n\nTo install, use pip: ``pip install properscoring``.\n\nExample: five ways to calculate CRPS\n------------------------------------\n\nThis library focuses on the closely related\n`Continuous Ranked Probability Score`_ (CRPS) and `Brier Score`_. We like\nthese scores because they are both interpretable (e.g., CRPS is a\ngeneralization of mean absolute error) and easily calculated from a finite\nnumber of samples of a probability distribution.\n\n.. _Continuous Ranked Probability Score: http://www.eumetcal.org/resources/ukmeteocal/verification/www/english/msg/ver_prob_forec/uos3b/uos3b_ko1.htm\n.. _Brier score: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score\n\nWe will illustrate how to calculate CRPS against a forecast given by a\nGaussian random variable. To begin, import properscoring::\n\n    import numpy as np\n    import properscoring as ps\n    from scipy.stats import norm\n\nExact calculation using ``crps_gaussian`` (this is the fastest method)::\n\n    >>>> ps.crps_gaussian(0, mu=0, sig=1)\n    0.23369497725510913\n\nNumerical integration with ``crps_quadrature``::\n\n    >>> ps.crps_quadrature(0, norm)\n    array(0.23369497725510724)\n\nFrom a finite sample with ``crps_ensemble``::\n\n    >>> ensemble = np.random.RandomState(0).randn(1000)\n    >>> ps.crps_ensemble(0, ensemble)\n    0.2297109370729622\n\nWeighted by PDF values with ``crps_ensemble``::\n\n    >>> x = np.linspace(-5, 5, num=1000)\n    >>> ps.crps_ensemble(0, x, weights=norm.pdf(x))\n    0.23370047937569616\n\nBased on the `threshold decomposition`_ of CRPS with\n``threshold_brier_score``::\n\n    >>> threshold_scores = ps.threshold_brier_score(0, ensemble, threshold=x)\n    >>> (x[1] - x[0]) * threshold_scores.sum(axis=-1)\n    0.22973090090090081\n\n.. _threshold decomposition: https://www.stat.washington.edu/research/reports/2008/tr533.pdf\n\nIn this example, we only scored a single observation/forecast pair. But\nto reliably evaluate a forecast model, you need to average these scores across\nmany observations. Fortunately, all scoring rules in properscoring happily\naccept and return observations as multi-dimensional arrays::\n\n    >>> ps.crps_gaussian([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2], mu=0, sig=1)\n    array([ 1.45279182,  0.60244136,  0.23369498,  0.60244136,  1.45279182])\n\nOnce you calculate an average score, is often useful to normalize them\nrelative to a baseline forecast to calculate a so-called \"skill score\",\ndefined such that 0 indicates no improvement over the baseline and 1\nindicates a perfect forecast. For example, suppose that our baseline\nforecast is to always predict 0::\n\n    >>> obs = [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]\n    >>> baseline_score = ps.crps_ensemble(obs, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]).mean()\n    >>> forecast_score = ps.crps_gaussian(obs, mu=0, sig=1).mean()\n    >>> skill = (baseline_score - forecast_score) / baseline_score\n    >>> skill\n    0.27597311068630859\n\nA standard normal distribution was 28% better at predicting these five\nobservations.\n\nAPI\n---\n\nproperscoring contains optimized and extensively tested routines for\nscoring probability forecasts. These functions currently fall into two\ncategories:\n\n* Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS):\n\n  - for an ensemble forecast: ``crps_ensemble``\n  - for a Gaussian distribution: ``crps_gaussian``\n  - for an arbitrary cumulative distribution function: ``crps_quadrature``\n\n* Brier score:\n\n  - for binary probability forecasts: ``brier_score``\n  - for threshold exceedances with an ensemble forecast: ``threshold_brier_score``\n\nAll functions are robust to missing values represented by the floating\npoint value ``NaN``.\n\nHistory\n-------\n\nThis library was written by researchers at The Climate Corporation.
