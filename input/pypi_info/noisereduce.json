It relies on a method called \"spectral gating\" which is a form of [Noise Gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise_gate). It works by computing a spectrogram of a signal (and optionally a noise signal) and estimating a noise threshold (or gate) for each frequency band of that signal/noise. That threshold is used to compute a mask, which gates noise below the frequency-varying threshold. \n\nThe most recent version of noisereduce comprises two algorithms:\n1. **Stationary Noise Reduction**: Keeps the estimated noise threshold at the same level across the whole signal\n2. **Non-stationary Noise Reduction**: Continuously updates the estimated noise threshold over time\n\n### Version 3 Updates:\n- Includes a PyTorch-based implementation of Spectral Gating, an algorithm for denoising audio signals. \n- You can now create a noisereduce nn.Module object which allows it to be used either as a standalone module or as part of a larger neural network architecture.\n- The run time of the algorithm decreases substantially.\n\n### Version 2 Updates:\n- Added two forms of spectral gating noise reduction: stationary noise reduction, and non-stationary noise reduction. \n- Added multiprocessing so you can perform noise reduction on bigger data.\n- The new version breaks the API of the old version. \n- The previous version is still available at `from noisereduce.noisereducev1 import reduce_noise`\n- You can now create a noisereduce object which allows you to reduce noise on subsets of longer recordings\n\n# Stationary Noise Reduction\n- The basic intuition is that statistics are calculated on  each frequency channel to determine a noise gate. Then the gate is applied to the signal.\n- This algorithm is based (but not completely reproducing) on the one [outlined by Audacity](https://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/How_Audacity_Noise_Reduction_Works) for the **noise reduction effect** ([Link to C++ code](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/blob/master/src/effects/NoiseReduction.cpp))\n- The algorithm takes two inputs: \n    1. A *noise* clip containing prototypical noise of clip (optional)\n    2. A *signal* clip containing the signal and the noise intended to be removed\n\n### Steps of the Stationary Noise Reduction algorithm\n1. A spectrogram is calculated over the noise audio clip\n2. Statistics are calculated over spectrogram of the the noise (in frequency)\n3. A threshold is calculated based upon the statistics of the noise (and the desired sensitivity of the algorithm) \n4. A spectrogram is calculated over the signal\n5. A mask is determined by comparing the signal spectrogram to the threshold\n6. The mask is smoothed with a filter over frequency and time\n7. The mask is appled to the spectrogram of the signal, and is inverted\n*If the noise signal is not provided, the algorithm will treat the signal as the noise clip, which tends to work pretty well*\n\n# Non-stationary Noise Reduction\n- The non-stationary noise reduction algorithm is an extension of the stationary noise reduction algorithm, but allowing the noise gate to change over time. \n- When you know the timescale that your signal occurs on (e.g. a bird call can be a few hundred milliseconds), you can set your noise threshold based on the assumption that events occuring on longer timescales are noise. \n- This algorithm was motivated by a recent method in bioacoustics called Per-Channel Energy Normalization. \n\n### Steps of the Non-stationary Noise Reduction algorithm\n1. A spectrogram is calculated over the signal\n2. A time-smoothed version of the spectrogram is computed using an IIR filter aplied forward and backward on each frequency channel.\n3. A mask is computed based on that time-smoothed spectrogram\n4. The mask is smoothed with a filter over frequency and time\n5. The mask is appled to the spectrogram of the signal, and is inverted\n\n# Installation\n`pip install noisereduce`\n\n# Usage\nSee example notebook: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/timsainb/noisereduce/blob/master/notebooks/1.0-test-noise-reduction.ipynb)\nParallel computing example: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/timsainb/noisereduce/blob/master/notebooks/2.0-test-noisereduce-pytorch.ipynb)\n\n## reduce_noise\n\n### Simplest usage\n```\nfrom scipy.io import wavfile\nimport noisereduce as nr\n# load data\nrate, data = wavfile.read(\"mywav.wav\")\n# perform noise reduction\nreduced_noise = nr.reduce_noise(y=data, sr=rate)\nwavfile.write(\"mywav_reduced_noise.wav\", rate, reduced_noise)\n```\n\n### Arguments to `reduce_noise`\n```\ny : np.ndarray [shape=(# frames,) or (# channels, # frames)], real-valued\n      input signal\n  sr : int\n      sample rate of input signal / noise signal\n  y_noise : np.ndarray [shape=(# frames,) or (# channels, # frames)], real-valued\n      noise signal to compute statistics over (only for non-stationary noise reduction).\n  stationary : bool, optional\n      Whether to perform stationary, or non-stationary noise reduction, by default False\n  prop_decrease : float, optional\n      The proportion to reduce the noise by (1.0 = 100%), by default 1.0\n  time_constant_s : float, optional\n      The time constant, in seconds, to compute the noise floor in the non-stationary\n      algorithm, by default 2.0\n  freq_mask_smooth_hz : int, optional\n      The frequency range to smooth the mask over in Hz, by default 500\n  time_mask_smooth_ms : int, optional\n      The time range to smooth the mask over in milliseconds, by default 50\n  thresh_n_mult_nonstationary : int, optional\n      Only used in nonstationary noise reduction., by default 1\n  sigmoid_slope_nonstationary : int, optional\n      Only used in nonstationary noise reduction., by default 10\n  n_std_thresh_stationary : int, optional\n      Number of standard deviations above mean to place the threshold between\n      signal and noise., by default 1.5\n  tmp_folder : [type], optional\n      Temp folder to write waveform to during parallel processing.
