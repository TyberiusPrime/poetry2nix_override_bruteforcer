This particular PyPI package was published by Sasha Romijn.\n\n.. _SEKOIA.io fork: https://github.com/SEKOIA-IO/py-radix\n\nThe following attributes have been converted to properties and will be computed at query time:\n\n  * network\n  * prefix\n\nThe `data` object is now `None` by default instead of being an empty dict. It can be used to store any type of data.\n\npy-radix implements the radix tree data structure for the storage and\nretrieval of IPv4 and IPv6 network prefixes.\n\nThe radix tree is commonly used for routing table lookups. It efficiently\nstores network prefixes of varying lengths and allows fast lookups of\ncontaining networks.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstallation is a breeze via pip: ::\n\n    pip install py-radix\n\nOr with the standard Python distutils incantation: ::\n\n\tpython setup.py build\n\tpython setup.py install\n\nThe C extension will be built for supported python versions. If you do not\nwant the C extension, set the environment variable ``RADIX_NO_EXT=1``.\n\nTests are in the ``tests/`` directory and can be run with\n``python setup.py nosetests``.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nA simple example that demonstrates most of the features: ::\n\n\timport socket\n\timport radix\n\n\t# Create a new tree\n\trtree = radix.Radix()\n\n\t# Adding a node returns a RadixNode object. You can create\n\t# arbitrary members in its 'data' dict to store your data\n\trnode = rtree.add(\"10.0.0.0/8\")\n\trnode.data = {\"blah\": \"whatever you want\"}\n\n\t# You can specify nodes as CIDR addresses, or networks with\n\t# separate mask lengths. The following three invocations are\n\t# identical:\n\trnode = rtree.add(\"10.0.0.0/16\")\n\trnode = rtree.add(\"10.0.0.0\", 16)\n\trnode = rtree.add(network = \"10.0.0.0\", masklen = 16)\n\n\t# It is also possible to specify nodes using binary packed\n\t# addresses, such as those returned by the socket module\n\t# functions. In this case, the radix module will assume that\n\t# a four-byte address is an IPv4 address and a sixteen-byte\n\t# address is an IPv6 address. For example:\n\tbinary_addr = socket.inet_aton(\"172.18.22.0\")\n\trnode = rtree.add(packed = binary_addr, masklen = 23)\n\n\t# Exact search will only return prefixes you have entered\n\t# You can use all of the above ways to specify the address\n\trnode = rtree.search_exact(\"10.0.0.0/8\")\n\t# Get your data back out\n\tprint(rnode.data[\"blah\"])\n\t# Use a packed address\n\taddr = socket.inet_aton(\"10.0.0.0\")\n\trnode = rtree.search_exact(packed = addr, masklen = 8)\n\n\t# Best-match search will return the longest matching prefix\n\t# that contains the search term (routing-style lookup)\n\trnode = rtree.search_best(\"10.123.45.6\")\n\n\t# Worst-search will return the shortest matching prefix\n\t# that contains the search term (inverse routing-style lookup)\n\trnode = rtree.search_worst(\"10.123.45.6\")\n\n\t# Covered search will return all prefixes inside the given\n\t# search term, as a list (including the search term itself,\n\t# if present in the tree)\n\trnodes = rtree.search_covered(\"10.123.0.0/16\")\n\n\t# There are a couple of implicit members of a RadixNode:\n\tprint(rnode.network)     # -> \"10.0.0.0\"\n\tprint(rnode.prefix)      # -> \"10.0.0.0/8\"\n\tprint(rnode.prefixlen)   # -> 8\n\tprint(rnode.family)      # -> socket.AF_INET\n\tprint(rnode.packed)      # -> '\\n\\x00\\x00\\x00'\n\n\t# IPv6 prefixes are fully supported in the same tree\n\trnode = rtree.add(\"2001:DB8::/3\")\n\trnode = rtree.add(\"::/0\")\n\n\t# Use the nodes() method to return all RadixNodes created\n\tnodes = rtree.nodes()\n\tfor rnode in nodes:\n\t\tprint(rnode.prefix)\n\n\t# The prefixes() method will return all the prefixes (as a\n\t# list of strings) that have been entered\n\tprefixes = rtree.prefixes()\n\n\t# You can also directly iterate over the tree itself\n\t# this would save some memory if the tree is big\n\t# NB. Don't modify the tree (add or delete nodes) while\n\t# iterating otherwise you will abort the iteration and\n\t# receive a RuntimeWarning. Changing a node's data dict\n\t# is permitted.\n\tfor rnode in rtree:\n\t\tprint(rnode.prefix)\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\npy-radix is licensed under a ISC/BSD licence.
