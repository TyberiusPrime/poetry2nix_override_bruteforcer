It parses C header files\nand creates a wrapper for libraries based on what it finds.\n\nPreprocessor macros are handled in a manner consistent with typical C code.\nPreprocessor macro functions are translated into Python functions that are then\nmade available to the user of the newly-generated Python wrapper library.\n\nIt can also output JSON, which can be used with Mork, which generates bindings\nfor Lua, using the alien module (which binds libffi to Lua).\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee https://github.com/ctypesgen/ctypesgen/wiki for full documentation.\n\nRun `ctypesgen --help` for full range of available options.\n\n## Installation\n\n_ctypesgen_ can be installed by `pip install ctypesgen`. It requires Python 3.7\nto run.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nThis project automatically generates ctypes wrappers for header files written\nin C.\n\nFor example, if you'd like to generate Neon bindings, you can do so using this\nrecipe (using a standard pip install):\n\n```sh\nctypesgen -lneon /usr/local/include/neon/ne_*.h -o neon.py\n```\n\nSome libraries, such as APR, need special flags to compile. You can pass these\nflags in on the command line.\n\nFor example:\n\n```sh\nFLAGS = `apr-1-config --cppflags --includes`\nctypesgen $FLAGS -llibapr-1.so $HOME/include/apr-1/apr*.h -o apr.py\n```\n\nSometimes, libraries will depend on each other. You can specify these\ndependencies using -mmodule, where module is the name of the dependency module.\n\nHere's an example for apr_util:\n\n```sh\nctypesgen $FLAGS -llibaprutil-1.so $HOME/include/apr-1/ap[ru]*.h \\\n\t-mapr -o apr_util.py\n```\n\nIf you want JSON output (e.g. for generating Lua bindings), use\n\n```\n--output-language=json\n```\n\nWhen outputting JSON, you will probably also want to use\n\n```\n--all-headers --builtin-symbols --no-stddef-types --no-gnu-types\n--no-python-types\n```\n\n## Related Software of Interest\n\n_libffi_ is a portable Foreign Function Interface library:\nhttp://sources.redhat.com/libffi/\n\n_Mork_, the friendly alien, can be found at:\nhttps://github.com/rrthomas/mork\n\n## License\n\n_ctypesgen_ is distributed under the New (2-clause) BSD License:\nhttp://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php\n\nCopyright (c) 2007-2022, Ctypesgen Developers\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n1.

Parse gcc attributes more\n\nImplements automatic calling convention selection based on gcc attributes for\nstdcall/cdecl.\n\n- Simplify and unify library loader for various platforms. Improve library path\n  searches on Linux (parsed ld.so.conf includes now).\n- First implementaion of #pragma pack\n- First implemenation of #undef\n- Adds several command line options:\n  `-D` `--define`\n  `-U` `--undefine`\n  `--no-undefs`\n  `-P` `--strip-prefix`\n  `--debug-level`\n\n### v1.0.1\n\nFix handling of function prototypes \n\nOther minor improvments included.\n\n### v1.0.0\n\nPy2/Py3 support \n\nVarious development branches merged back\n\nIn addition to the various developments from the different branches, this\ntag also represents a code state that:\n\n- ties in with Travis CI to watch code developments\n- improves testsuite, including moving all JSON tests to testsuite\n- includes a decent Debian package build configuration\n- automatically creates a man page to be included in the Debian package\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/ctypesgen/ctypesgen","keywords":"","license":"BSD-2-Clause","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"ctypesgen","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/ctypesgen/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/ctypesgen/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://github.com/ctypesgen/ctypesgen"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/ctypesgen/1.1.1/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":">=3.7","summary":"Python
