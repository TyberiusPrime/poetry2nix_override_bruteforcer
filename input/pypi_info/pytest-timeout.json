This plugin is designed to catch\n   excessively long test durations like deadlocked or hanging tests,\n   it is not designed for precise timings or performance regressions.\n   Remember your test suite should aim to be **fast**, with timeouts\n   being a last resort, not an expected failure mode.\n\nThis plugin will time each test and terminate it when it takes too\nlong.  Termination may or may not be graceful, please see below, but\nwhen aborting it will show a stack dump of all thread running at the\ntime.  This is useful when running tests under a continuous\nintegration server or simply if you don't know why the test suite\nhangs.\n\n.. note::\n\n   While by default on POSIX systems pytest will continue to execute\n   the tests after a test has timed out this is not always possible.\n   Often the only sure way to interrupt a hanging test is by\n   terminating the entire process.  As this is a hard termination\n   (``os._exit()``) it will result in no teardown, JUnit XML output\n   etc.  But the plugin will ensure you will have the debugging output\n   on stderr nevertheless, which is the most important part at this\n   stage.  See below for detailed information on the timeout methods\n   and their side-effects.\n\nThe pytest-timeout plugin has been tested on Python 3.6 and higher,\nincluding PyPy3.  See tox.ini for currently tested versions.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nInstall is as simple as e.g.::\n\n   pip install pytest-timeout\n\nNow you can run the test suite while setting a timeout in seconds, any\nindividual test which takes longer than the given duration will be\nterminated::\n\n   pytest --timeout=300\n\nFurthermore you can also use a decorator to set the timeout for an\nindividual test.  If combined with the ``--timeout`` flag this will\noverride the timeout for this individual test:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   @pytest.mark.timeout(60)\n   def test_foo():\n       pass\n\nBy default the plugin will not time out any tests, you must specify a\nvalid timeout for the plugin to interrupt long-running tests.  A\ntimeout is always specified as a number of seconds, and can be\ndefined in a number of ways, from low to high priority:\n\n1. You can set a global timeout in the `pytest configuration file`__\n   using the ``timeout`` option.  E.g.:\n\n   .. code:: ini\n\n      [pytest]\n      timeout = 300\n\n2. The ``PYTEST_TIMEOUT`` environment variable sets a global timeout\n   overriding a possible value in the configuration file.\n\n3. The ``--timeout`` command line option sets a global timeout\n   overriding both the environment variable and configuration option.\n\n4. Using the ``timeout`` marker_ on test items you can specify\n   timeouts on a per-item basis:\n\n   .. code:: python\n\n      @pytest.mark.timeout(300)\n      def test_foo():\n          pass\n\n__ https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#ini-options-ref\n\n.. _marker: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.html\n\nSetting a timeout to 0 seconds disables the timeout, so if you have a\nglobal timeout set you can still disable the timeout by using the\nmark.\n\nTimeout Methods\n===============\n\nInterrupting tests which hang is not always as simple and can be\nplatform dependent.  Furthermore some methods of terminating a test\nmight conflict with the code under test itself.  The pytest-timeout\nplugin tries to pick the most suitable method based on your platform,\nbut occasionally you may need to specify a specific timeout method\nexplicitly.\n\n   If a timeout method does not work your safest bet is to use the\n   *thread* method.\n\nthread\n------\n\nThis is the surest and most portable method.  It is also the default\non systems not supporting the *signal* method.  For each test item the\npytest-timeout plugin starts a timer thread which will terminate the\nwhole process after the specified timeout.  When a test item finishes\nthis timer thread is cancelled and the test run continues.\n\nThe downsides of this method are that there is a relatively large\noverhead for running each test and that test runs are not completed.\nThis means that other pytest features, like e.g. JUnit XML output or\nfixture teardown, will not function normally.  The second issue might\nbe alleviated by using the ``--boxed`` option of the pytest-xdist_\nplugin.\n\n.. _pytest-xdist: https://pypi.org/project/pytest-xdist/\n\nThe benefit of this method is that it will always work.  Furthermore\nit will still provide you debugging information by printing the stacks\nof all the threads in the application to stderr.\n\nsignal\n------\n\nIf the system supports the SIGALRM signal the *signal* method will be\nused by default.  This method schedules an alarm when the test item\nstarts and cancels the alarm when the test finishes.  If the alarm expires\nduring the test the signal handler will dump the stack of any other threads\nrunning to stderr and use ``pytest.fail()`` to interrupt the test.\n\nThe benefit of this method is that the pytest process is not\nterminated and the test run can complete normally.\n\nThe main issue to look out for with this method is that it may\ninterfere with the code under test.  If the code under test uses\nSIGALRM itself things will go wrong and you will have to choose the\n*thread* method.\n\nSpecifying the Timeout Method\n-----------------------------\n\nThe timeout method can be specified by using the ``timeout_method``\noption in the `pytest configuration file`__, the ``--timeout_method``\ncommand line parameter or the ``timeout`` marker_.  Simply set their\nvalue to the string ``thread`` or ``signal`` to override the default\nmethod.  On a marker this is done using the ``method`` keyword:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   @pytest.mark.timeout(method=\"thread\")\n   def test_foo():\n       pass\n\n__ https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/reference.html#ini-options-ref\n\n.. _marker: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.html\n\nThe ``timeout`` Marker API\n==========================\n\nThe full signature of the timeout marker is:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   pytest.mark.timeout(timeout=0, method=DEFAULT_METHOD)\n\nYou can use either positional or keyword arguments for both the\ntimeout and the method.  Neither needs to be present.\n\nSee the marker api documentation_ and examples_ for the various ways\nmarkers can be applied to test items.\n\n.. _documentation: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/mark.html\n\n.. _examples: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/example/markers.html#marking-whole-classes-or-modules\n\n\nTimeouts in Fixture Teardown\n============================\n\nThe plugin will happily terminate timeouts in the finalisers of\nfixtures.  The timeout specified applies to the entire process of\nsetting up fixtures, running the tests and finalising the fixtures.\nHowever when a timeout occurs in a fixture finaliser and the test\nsuite continues, i.e. the signal method is used, it must be realised\nthat subsequent fixtures which need to be finalised might not have\nbeen executed, which could result in a broken test-suite anyway.  In\ncase of doubt the thread method which terminates the entire process\nmight result in clearer output.\n\nAvoiding timeouts in Fixtures\n=============================\n\nThe timeout applies to the entire test including any fixtures which\nmay need to be setup or torn down for the test (the exact affected\nfixtures depends on which scope they are and whether other tests will\nstill use the same fixture).  If the timeouts really are too short to\ninclude fixture durations, firstly make the timeouts larger ;).  If\nthis really isn't an option a ``timeout_func_only`` boolean setting\nexists which can be set in the pytest ini configuration file, as\ndocumented in ``pytest --help``.\n\nFor the decorated function, a decorator will override\n``timeout_func_only = true`` in the pytest ini file to the default\nvalue. If you need to keep this option for a decorated test, you\nmust specify the option explicitly again:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   @pytest.mark.timeout(60, func_only=True)\n   def test_foo():\n       pass\n\n\nDebugger Detection\n==================\n\nThis plugin tries to avoid triggering the timeout when a debugger is\ndetected.  This is mostly a convenience so you do not need to remember\nto disable the timeout when interactively debugging.\n\nThe way this plugin detects whether or not a debugging session is\nactive is by checking if a trace function is set and if one is, it\ncheck to see if the module it belongs to is present in a set of known\ndebugging frameworks modules OR if pytest itself drops you into a pdb\nsession using ``--pdb`` or similar.\n\nThis functionality can be disabled with the ``--disable-debugger-detection`` flag\nor the corresponding ``timeout_disable_debugger_detection`` ini setting / environment\nvariable.\n\n\nExtending pytest-timeout with plugins\n=====================================\n\n``pytest-timeout`` provides two hooks that can be used for extending the tool.  These\nhooks are used for setting the timeout timer and cancelling it if the timeout is not\nreached.\n\nFor example, ``pytest-asyncio`` can provide asyncio-specific code that generates better\ntraceback and points on timed out ``await`` instead of the running loop iteration.\n\nSee `pytest hooks documentation\n<https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/how-to/writing_hook_functions.html>`_ for more info\nregarding to use custom hooks.\n\n``pytest_timeout_set_timer``\n----------------------------\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   @pytest.hookspec(firstresult=True)\n   def pytest_timeout_set_timer(item, settings):\n       \"\"\"Called at timeout setup.\n\n       'item' is a pytest node to setup timeout for.\n\n       'settings' is Settings namedtuple (described below).\n\n       Can be overridden by plugins for alternative timeout implementation strategies.\n       \"\"\"\n\n\n``Settings``\n------------\n\nWhen ``pytest_timeout_set_timer`` is called, ``settings`` argument is passed.\n\nThe argument has ``Settings`` namedtuple type with the following fields:\n\n+-----------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------+\n|Attribute  | Index | Value                                                  |\n+===========+=======+========================================================+\n| timeout   | 0     | timeout in seconds or ``None`` for no timeout          |\n+-----------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------+\n| method    | 1     | Method mechanism,                                      |\n|           |       | ``'signal'`` and ``'thread'`` are supported by default |\n+-----------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------+\n| func_only | 2     | Apply timeout to test function only if ``True``,       |\n|           |       |  wrap all test function and its fixtures otherwise     |\n+-----------+-------+--------------------------------------------------------+\n\n``pytest_timeout_cancel_timer``\n-------------------------------\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   @pytest.hookspec(firstresult=True)\n   def pytest_timeout_cancel_timer(item):\n       \"\"\"Called at timeout teardown.\n\n       'item' is a pytest node which was used for timeout setup.\n\n       Can be overridden by plugins for alternative timeout implementation strategies.\n       \"\"\"\n\n``is_debugging``\n----------------\n\nWhen the timeout occurs, user can open the debugger session. In this case, the timeout\nshould be discarded.  A custom hook can check this case by calling ``is_debugging()``\nfunction:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n   import pytest\n   import pytest_timeout\n\n\n   def on_timeout():\n       if pytest_timeout.is_debugging():\n           return\n       pytest.fail(\"+++ Timeout +++\")\n\n\n\nSession Timeout\n===============\n\nThe above mentioned timeouts are all per test function. \nThe \"per test function\" timeouts will stop an individual test\nfrom taking too long. We may also want to limit the time of the entire \nset of tests running in one session. A session all of the tests\nthat will be run with one invokation of pytest.\n\nA session timeout is set with `--session-timeout` and is in seconds.\n\nThe following example shows a session timeout of 10 minutes (600 seconds)::\n\n   pytest --session-timeout=600\n\nYou can also set the session timeout the pytest configuration file using the ``session_timeout`` option:\n\n   .. code:: ini\n\n      [pytest]\n      session_timeout = 600\n\nCooperative timeouts\n--------------------\n\nSession timeouts are cooperative timeouts.  pytest-timeout checks the\nsession time at the end of each test function, and stops further tests\nfrom running if the session timeout is exceeded.  The session will\nresults in a test failure if this occurs.\n\nIn particular this means if a test does not finish of itself, it will\nonly be interrupted if there is also a function timeout set.  A\nsession timeout is not enough to ensure that a test-suite is\nguaranteed to finish.\n\nCombining session and function timeouts\n---------------------------------------\n\nIt works fine to combine both session and function timeouts.  In fact\nwhen using a session timeout it is recommended to also provide a\nfunction timeout.\n\nFor example, to limit test functions to 5 seconds and the full session\nto 100 seconds::\n\n   pytest --timeout=5 --session-timeout=100\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n2.3.1\n-----\n\n- Fixup some build errors, mostly README syntax which stopped twine\n  from uploading.\n\n2.3.0\n-----\n\n- Fix debugger detection for recent VSCode, this compiles pydevd using\n  cython which is now correctly detected.
