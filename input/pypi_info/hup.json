It was originally created in 2019 for the\n[Liquid Code](https://www.frootlab.org/liquid) project to separate\n[Pandora](https://www.frootlab.org/pandora) and\n[Nemoa](https://www.frootlab.org/nemoa). The majority of the provided\nmodules, however, are kept generic to facilitate their application beyond\nFrootlab projects as well.\n\nHup is free and open source software, based on the\n[Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and actively developed at\n[Frootlab](https://www.frootlab.org).\n\nCurrent Development Status\n--------------------------\n\nThe individual modules comprised within Hup are in\ndifferent development stages, ranging from *Planning* to *Mature*. In case of\ndoubt, the individual stages can be requested by the authors listed within the\n\\_\\_authors\\_\\_ attribute of the respective modules.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nComprehensive information and installation support is provided within the\n[online manual](https://hup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). If you already have a\nPython environment configured on your computer, you can install the latest\ndistributed version by using pip:\n\n    $ pip install hup\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe documentation of the latest distributed version is available as an [online\nmanual](https://hup.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and for download, given in the\nformats [PDF](https://readthedocs.org/projects/hup/downloads/pdf/latest/),\n[EPUB](https://readthedocs.org/projects/hup/downloads/epub/latest/) and\n[HTML](https://readthedocs.org/projects/hup/downloads/htmlzip/latest/).\n\nContribute\n----------\n\nContributors are very welcome!
