These are dictionaries with\nattribute access of the elements. They wrap any lower level dictionaries they\noutput, so the interface mimics the \"struct\" container from Matlab.\n\nBunch\n------\n\nThe Bunch class is a lightweight wrapper for dictionaries to allow attribute\naccess as a means to access elements with less syntax. Bunch does not copy\nassigned dictionaries, it wraps them. This is unlike some other implementations\nsuch as gwinc.Struct.\n\n```python\nd = dict(A=1, B=2, d2=dict(C=1))\n\nb1 = Bunch(d)\nprint(b1.A)\nprint(b1.d2.C)\n```\n\nor \n\n```python\nb2 = dict(A=1, B=2, d2=dict(C=1))\nprint(b2.A)\nprint(b2.d2.C)\n```\n\nA useful pattern while developing and debugging code, particularly while refactoring large\nblocks of code into functions is\n\n```python\ndef code_block(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...):\n    ...\n    a = 1\n    b = 2\n    ...\n    return Bunch(locals())\n    \nret = code_block(...)\nret.a\n```\n\nwhich is a lightweight way to access elements from the code_block that is\npromoted into a function.\n\nDeepBunch\n-----------\nThere are a collection of more advanced containers\nDeepBunch allows speculative access of elements, such that if it is missing\nan attribute, a temporary is created such that \n\n```python\nA = DeepBunch()\nA.B.C.D = 1\n```\n\nis acceptable.\n\nand \n\n```\nif A.B.C.E:\n  raise Exception('The above test evaluates to False')\n```\n\nand in this case, no intermediate dictionaries are actually created until a value is assigned to a leaf.\n\n\nHDFDeepBunch\n---------------\n\nh5py is not a required dependency of wield.bunch, but if it is installed\nthen one can import the `HDFDeepBunch`, which provides a similar interface to\nthe DeepBunch, but uses HDF5 files as a back-end, with internal handling of\nnumpy arrays.\n\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/wieldphysics/wield-bunch","keywords":"","license":"Apache-2.0","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"wield.bunch","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/wield.bunch/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/wield.bunch/","project_urls":{"Bug
