Full\ndocumentation can be found at\n [rlax.readthedocs.io](https://rlax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install the latest released version of RLax from PyPI via:\n\n```sh\npip install rlax\n```\n\nor you can install the latest development version from GitHub:\n\n```sh\npip install git+https://github.com/deepmind/rlax.git\n```\n\nAll RLax code may then be just in time compiled for different hardware\n(e.g. CPU, GPU, TPU) using `jax.jit`.\n\nIn order to run the `examples/` you will also need to clone the repo and\ninstall the additional requirements:\n[optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax),\n[haiku](https://github.com/deepmind/haiku), and\n[bsuite](https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite).\n\n## Content\n\nThe operations and functions provided are not complete algorithms, but\nimplementations of reinforcement learning specific mathematical operations that\nare needed when building fully-functional agents capable of learning:\n\n* Values, including both state and action-values;\n* Values for Non-linear generalizations of the Bellman equations.\n* Return Distributions, aka distributional value functions;\n* General Value Functions, for cumulants other than the main reward;\n* Policies, via policy-gradients in both continuous and discrete action spaces.\n\nThe library supports both on-policy and off-policy learning (i.e. learning from\ndata sampled from a policy different from the agent's policy).\n\nSee file-level and function-level doc-strings for the documentation of these\nfunctions and for references to the papers that introduced and/or used them.\n\n## Usage\n\nSee `examples/` for examples of using some of the functions in RLax to\nimplement a few simple reinforcement learning agents, and demonstrate learning\non BSuite's version of the Catch environment (a common unit-test for\nagent development in the reinforcement learning literature):\n\nOther examples of JAX reinforcement learning agents using `rlax` can be found in\n[bsuite](https://github.com/deepmind/bsuite/tree/master/bsuite/baselines).\n\n## Background\n\nReinforcement learning studies the problem of a learning system (the *agent*),\nwhich must learn to interact with the universe it is embedded in (the\n*environment*).\n\nAgent and environment interact on discrete steps. On each step the agent selects\nan *action*, and is provided in return a (partial) snapshot of the state of the\nenvironment (the *observation*), and a scalar feedback signal (the *reward*).\n\nThe behaviour of the agent is characterized by a probability distribution over\nactions, conditioned on past observations of the environment (the *policy*). The\nagents seeks a policy that, from any given step, maximises the discounted\ncumulative reward that will be collected from that point onwards (the *return*).\n\nOften the agent policy or the environment dynamics itself are stochastic. In\nthis case the return is a random variable, and the optimal agent's policy is\ntypically more precisely specified as a policy that maximises the expectation of\nthe return (the *value*), under the agent's and environment's stochasticity.\n\n## Reinforcement Learning Algorithms\n\nThere are three prototypical families of reinforcement learning algorithms:\n\n1.  those that estimate the value of states and actions, and infer a policy by\n    *inspection* (e.g. by selecting the action with highest estimated value)\n2.  those that learn a model of the environment (capable of predicting the\n    observations and rewards) and infer a policy via *planning*.\n3.  those that parameterize a policy that can be directly *executed*,\n\nIn any case, policies, values or models are just functions. In deep\nreinforcement learning such functions are represented by a neural network.\nIn this setting, it is common to formulate reinforcement learning updates as\ndifferentiable pseudo-loss functions (analogously to (un-)supervised learning).\nUnder automatic differentiation, the original update rule is recovered.\n\nNote however, that in particular, the updates are only valid if the input data\nis sampled in the correct manner. For example, a policy gradient loss is only\nvalid if the input trajectory is an unbiased sample from the current policy;\ni.e. the data are on-policy. The library cannot check or enforce such\nconstraints. Links to papers describing how each operation is used are however\nprovided in the functions' doc-strings.\n\n## Naming Conventions and Developer Guidelines\n\nWe define functions and operations for agents interacting with a single stream\nof experience. The JAX construct `vmap` can be used to apply these same\nfunctions to batches (e.g. to support *replay* and *parallel* data generation).\n\nMany functions consider policies, actions, rewards, values, in consecutive\ntimesteps in order to compute their outputs. In this case the suffix `_t` and\n`tm1` is often to clarify on which step each input was generated, e.g:\n\n*   `q_tm1`: the action value in the `source` state of a transition.\n*   `a_tm1`: the action that was selected in the `source` state.\n*   `r_t`: the resulting rewards collected in the `destination` state.\n*   `discount_t`: the `discount` associated with a transition.\n*   `q_t`: the action values in the `destination` state.\n\nExtensive testing is provided for each function. All tests should also verify\nthe output of `rlax` functions when compiled to XLA using `jax.jit` and when\nperforming batch operations using `jax.vmap`.\n\n## Citing RLax\n\nRLax is part of the
