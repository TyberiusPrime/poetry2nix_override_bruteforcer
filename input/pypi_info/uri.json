We\nprefer light-weight `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/virtualenv.html>`__, others prefer solutions as\nrobust as `Vagrant <http://www.vagrantup.com>`__.\n\nIf you add ``uri`` to the ``install_requires`` argument of the call to ``setup()`` in your application's\n``setup.py`` file, ``uri`` will be automatically installed and made available when your own application or\nlibrary is installed.  We recommend using \"less than\" version numbers to ensure there are no unintentional\nside-effects when updating.  Use ``uri<2.1`` to get all bugfixes for the current release, and\n``uri<3.0`` to get bugfixes and feature updates while ensuring that large breaking changes are not installed.\n\nWhile uri does not have any hard dependencies on any other package, it is **strongly** recommended that applications\nusing uri in web-based applications also install the ``markupsafe`` package to provide more efficient string escaping and\nsome additional functionality.\n\n\nDevelopment Version\n-------------------\n\n    |developstatus| |developcover| |ghsince| |issuecount| |ghfork|\n\nDevelopment takes place on `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__ in the\n`uri <https://github.com/marrow/uri/>`__ project.  Issue tracking, documentation, and downloads\nare provided there.\n\nInstalling the current development version requires `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`__, a distributed source code management\nsystem.  If you have Git you can run the following to download and *link* the development version into your Python\nruntime::\n\n    git clone https://github.com/marrow/uri.git\n    (cd uri; python setup.py develop)\n\nYou can then upgrade to the latest version at any time::\n\n    (cd uri; git pull; python setup.py develop)\n\nIf you would like to make changes and contribute them back to the project, fork the GitHub project, make your changes,\nand submit a pull request.  This process is beyond the scope of this documentation; for more information see\n`GitHub's documentation <http://help.github.com/>`_.\n\n\nGetting Started\n===============\n\n\nURI\n---\n\nAn abstract string-like (and mapping-like, and iterator-like...) identifier for a resource with the regular form\ndefined by `RFC 3986 <http://pretty-rfc.herokuapp.com/RFC3986>`_::\n\n    scheme:[//[user[:password]@]host[:port]][/path][?query][#fragment]\n\nFor details on these components, `please refer to Wikipedia\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Syntax>`__. Each of these components is represented by an\nappropraite rich datatype:\n\n* The ``scheme`` of a URI represents an extensible API of string-like plugins.\n* Any IPv6 ``host`` is automatically wrapped and unwrapped in square braces.\n* The ``path`` is represented by a ``PurePosixPath``.\n* The ``query`` is a rich ordered multi-value bucketed mutable mapping called ``QSO``. (Ouch, but that's what it is!)\n\nInstantiate a new URI by passing in a string or string-castable object, ``pathlib.Path`` compatible object, or object\nexposing a ``__link__`` method or attribute::\n\n    home = URI(\"https://github.com/marrow/\")\n\nThe *scalar* attributes are combined into several *compound* groups for convienence:\n\n* The ``credentials`` are a colon (``:``) separated combination of: ``user`` + ``password`` — also accessible via the\n  shorter ``auth`` or the longer ``authentication`` attributes.\n* The ``authority`` part is the combination of: ``credentials`` + ``host`` + ``port``\n* The ``heirarchical`` part is the combination of: ``authority`` part + ``path``\n\nOther aliases are provided for the scalar components, typically for compliance with external APIs, such as\ninteroperability with ``pathlib.Path`` or ``urlsplit`` objects:\n\n* ``username`` is the long form of ``user``.\n* ``hostname`` is the long form of ``host``.\n* ``authentication`` is the long form of ``auth``.\n\nIn addition, several string views are provided for convienence, but ultimately all just call `str()` against the\ninstance or one of the compound groups described above:\n\n* ``uri`` represents the entire URI as a string.\n* ``safe_uri`` represents the enture URI, sans any password that may be present.\n* ``base`` is the combination of ``scheme`` and the ``heirarchical`` part.\n* ``summary`` is a useful shortcut for web presentation containing only the ``host`` and ``port`` of the URI.\n* ``qs`` is just the query string, as a plain string instead of QSO instance.\n\nURI values may be absolute identifiers or relative references. Absolute URIs are what most people see every day:\n\n* ``https://example.com/about/us``\n* ``ftp://example.com/thing.txt``\n* ``mailto:user@example.com``\n* ``uri:ISSN:1535-3613``\n\nIndirect references require the context of an absolute identifier in order to resolve them. Examples include:\n\n* ``//example.com/protocol/relative`` — protocol implied from context, frequently used in HTML when referencing\n  resources hosted on content delivery networks.\n* ``/host/relative`` — all elements *up to* the path are preserved from context, also frequently used in HTML when\n  referencing resources on the same server. This is not equivalent to ``file:///host/relative``, as the protocol is\n  unknown.\n* ``relative/path`` — the resulting path is relative to the \"current working directory\" of the context.\n* ``../parent/relative/path`` — references may ascend into parents of the context.\n* ``resource#fragment`` — referencing a specific fragment of a sibling resource.\n* ``#fragment`` — a same-document reference to a specific fragment of the context.\n\nTwo primary methods are provided to combine a base URI with another URI, absolute or relative.  The first, utilizing\nthe ``uri.resolve(uri, **parts)`` method, allows you to both resolve a target URL as well as provide explicit\noverrides for any of the above scalar attributes, such as query string. The second, which is recommended for general\nuse, is to use the division and floor division operators::\n\n    base = URI(\"https://example.com/about/us\")\n    cdn = base // \"cdn.example.com\"\n    js = cdn / \"script.js\"\n    css = cdn / \"script.css\"\n\nPlease note that once a URI has an \"authority\" part (basically, the parts prior to the path such as host) then any\npath directly assigned must be \"rooted\", or contain a leading slash.\n\n\nSchemes\n-------\n\nEach URI has a scheme which should be registered with the `Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)\n<https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority>`_ which specifies the mechanics of the URI\nfields.  Examples include: ``http``, ``https``, ``ftp``, ``mailto``, ``file``, ``data``, etc.\n\n\nVersion History\n===============\n\nVersion 2.0.1\n-------------\n\n* Added non-standard `resource` compound view.\n* Removed Python 3.3 support, added 3.7, removed deprecated testing dependency.\n* Scheme objects hash as per their string representation. #5\n* Dead code clean-up.\n* Additional tests covering previously uncovered edge cases, such as assignment to a compound view property.\n* Restrict assignment of rootless paths (no leading `/`) if an authority part is already present. #8\n* Enable handling of the following schemes as per URL (colon + double slash):\n\t* sftp\n\t* mysql\n\t* redis\n\t* mongodb\n\n\nVersion 2.0\n-----------\n\n* Extraction of the ``URIString`` object from Marrow Mongo.\n\n\nVersion 1.0\n-----------\n\n* Original package by Jacob Kaplan-Moss.
