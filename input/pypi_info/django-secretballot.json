It can be installed from PyPI:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    pip install django-secretballot\n\nSetup\n=====\n\nFirst of all, you must add this project to your list of ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in\n``settings.py`` :\n\n.. code-block:: python\n  \n    INSTALLED_APPS += [\n        \"secretballot\",\n    ]\n\nThere is only one mandatory configuration option you need to set in your ``settings.py``:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # In order to attach the voting helpers to a particular model it is enough\n    # to list them here...\n    SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS = {\n        \"<app_label.model_name>\": {},\n    }\n\nRun ``./manage.py migrate``. This creates the tables in your database\nthat are necessary for operation.\n\nPlease see ``example`` application. This application is used to manually\ntest the functionalities of this package. This also serves as a good\nexample.\n\nYou need Django 1.8 or above to run that. It might run on older\nversions but that is not tested.\n\nUsing voting-enabled models\n===========================\n\nOnce a model is voting-enabled a number of special fields are available on all instances:\n\nFields\n------\n\nVotable objects have the following fields:\n\n``votes``\n*********\n\nManager to of all ``Vote`` objects related to the current model (typically doesn't need to be accessed directly). Can be renamed by passing ``votes_name`` parameter to ``SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS``, for example:\n    \n.. code-block:: python\n\n    SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS = {\n        \"<app_label.model_name>\": {\n            \"votes_name\": \"vs\",\n        },\n    }\n    \n``total_upvotes``\n*****************\n\nTotal number of +1 votes. Can be renamed by passing ``upvotes_name`` parameter to ``SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS``, for example:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS = {\n        \"<app_label.model_name>\": {\n            \"upvotes_name\": \"total_upvs\",\n        },\n    }\n\n``total_downvotes``\n*******************\n\nTotal number of -1 votes. Can be renamed by passing ``downvotes_name`` parameter to ``SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS``, for example:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS = {\n        \"<app_label.model_name>\": {\n            \"downvotes_name\": \"total_downvs\",\n        },\n    }\n\n``vote_total``\n**************\n    \nShortcut accessor for (``total_upvotes`` minus ``total_downvotes``). Can be renamed by passing ``total_name`` parameter to ``SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS``, for example:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS = {\n        \"<app_label.model_name>\": {\n            \"total_name\": \"v_total\",\n        },\n    }\n\n``_secretballot_enabled``\n*************************\n\nBoolean indicating that ``secretballot`` is enabled (can be tested for with hasattr). Cannot be renamed, exists for a reliable check that secretballot is available even if all other fields were renamed.\n\nMethods\n-------\n\nVotable objects have the following custom methods:\n\n``add_vote``\n************\n\nFunction that takes a ``token`` and a vote (+1 or -1) and adds or updates the vote for said token. Can be renamed by passing ``add_vote_name`` parameter to ``SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS``, for example:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS = {\n        \"<app_label.model_name>\": {\n            \"add_vote_name\": \"add_v\",\n        },\n    }\n\n``remove_vote``\n***************\n\nFunction that takes a ``token`` and removes the vote (if present) for said token. Can be renamed by passing ``remove_vote_name`` parameter to ``SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS``, for example:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS = {\n        \"<app_label.model_name>\": {\n            \"remove_vote_name\": \"remove_v\",\n        },\n    }\n\nManager functions\n-----------------\n\nA special manager is added that enables the inclusion of ``total_upvotes`` and ``total_downvotes`` as well as some extra functionality.\n\nThis manager by default replaces the ``objects`` manager, but this can be altered by passing the ``manager_name`` parameter to ``SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS``, for example:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    SECRETBALLOT_FOR_MODELS = {\n        \"<app_label.model_name>\": {\n            \"manager_name\": \"ballot_custom_manager\",\n        },\n    }\n\n\nThere is also an additional method on the Votable manager:\n\n``from_request(self, request)``\n*******************************\n    \nWhen called on a votable object's queryset will add a ``user_vote`` attribute that is the vote cast by the current 'user' (actually the token assigned to the request), for example:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    def story_view(request, slug):\n        story = Story.objects.from_request(request).get(pk=slug)\n        # story has the following extra attributes\n        # user_vote: -1, 0, or +1\n        # total_upvotes: total number of +1 votes\n        # total_downvotes: total number of -1 votes\n        # vote_total: total_upvotes-total_downvotes\n        # votes: related object manager to get specific votes (rarely needed)\n\n\nTokens and SecretBallotMiddleware\n---------------------------------\n\nWithout user logins it is impossible to be certain that a user does not vote more than once, but there are several methods to limit abuses.  ``secretballot`` takes a fairly hands-off approach to this problem, the Vote object has a ``token`` field that is used to store a uniquely identifying token generated from a request.  To limit how many votes come from a particular ip address it is sufficient to set the token to the IP address, but it is also possible to develop more sophisticated heuristics to limit voters.\n\n``secretballot`` uses a simple piece of middleware to do this task, and makes it trival for users to define their own middleware that will use whatever heuristic they desire.\n\n``SecretBallotMiddleware`` is an abstract class that defines a ``generate_token(request)`` method that should return a string to be used for the token.  \n\nFor convenience several middleware have already been defined:\n\n``SecretBallotIpMiddleware``\n****************************\n\nSimply sets the ``token`` to ``request.META['REMOTE_ADDR']`` -- the user's IP address\n\n``SecretBallotIpUseragentMiddleware``\n*************************************\n\nSets the ``token`` to a hash of the user's ip address and user agent -- hopefully slightly more unique than IP alone\n\nIf you wish to define your own middleware simply derive a class from ``SecretBallotMiddleware`` and implement the ``generate_token`` method. If you come up with something that may be useful for others contributions are always welcome.\n\nGeneric Views\n-------------\n\n``secretballot.views`` includes the following generic views:\n\n``secretballot.views.vote``\n***************************\n\n**Description:**\n\nThis view creates or alters a vote on the object of ``content_type`` with a primary key of ``object_id``.\nIf a vote already exists it will be replaced (unless vote is 0 in which case it will be deleted).\n\nThe ``token`` attribute of the vote that is used to prevent unlimited voting is set within this view based on the active ``SecretBallotMiddleware``.\n\nDepending on the parameters given the return value of this view varies:\n    \n#. if ``redirect_url`` is specified it will be used no matter what\n#. if ``template_name`` is specified it will be used (along with ``template_loader``, ``context_processors`` and etc.)\n#. without ``redirect_url`` or ``template_name`` a text/json response will be returned\n\n**Required arguments:**\n\n* ``content_type`` : class that voting is taking place on (a VotableModel-derived model). \n\n  May be an instance of ``django.contrib.contenttypes.models.ContentType``, the Model class itself, or an ``<app_label.model_name>`` string.\n* ``object_id`` : primary key of object to vote on\n* ``vote`` : value of this vote (+1, 0, or -1) (0 deletes the vote)\n\n**Optional arguments:**\n\n* ``can_vote_test`` : function that allows limiting if user can vote or not. It's an optional argument to the view that can be specified in the urlconf that is called before a vote is recorded for a user.\n\n  Example implementation of ``can_vote_test``:\n\n  .. code-block:: python\n\n      from secretballot.utils import get_vote_model\n\n      def only_three_votes(request, content_type, object_id, vote):\n          return get_vote_model().objects.filter(content_type=content_type, token=request.secretballot_token).count() < 3\n\n  All ``can_vote_test`` methods must take the non-optional parameters to ``secretballot.views.vote`` and should return ``True`` if the vote should be allowed. If the vote is not allowed by default the view will return a 403, but it is also acceptable to raise a different exception.\n\n* ``redirect_url`` : url to redirect to, if present will redirect instead of returning a normal HttpResponse\n* ``template_name`` : template to render to, recieves a context containing ``content_obj`` which is the object voted upon\n* ``template_loader`` : template loader to use, defaults to ``django.template.loader``\n* ``extra_context`` : dictionary containing any extra context, callables will be called at render time\n* ``context_processors`` : list of context processors for this view\n* ``mimetype`` :  mimetype override\n\nCredits\n=======\n\n`django-secretballot <https://github.com/bashu/django-secretballot/>`_ was originally started by `James Turk
