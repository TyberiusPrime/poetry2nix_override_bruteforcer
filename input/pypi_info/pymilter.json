Build and install Sendmail, enabling libmilter (see libmilter/README).\n 2. Build and install Python, enabling threading.\n 3. Install this module: python setup.py --help\n 4. Add these two lines to sendmail.cf[a]:\n\n O InputMailFilters=pythonfilter\n Xpythonfilter,        S=local:/home/username/pythonsock\n\n 5. Run the sample.py example milter with: python sample.py\n Note that milters should almost certainly not run as root.\n\nThat's it.  Incoming mail will cause the milter to print some things, and\nsome email will be rejected (see the \"header\" method).  Edit and play.  \nSee spfmilter.py for a functional SPF milter, or see bms.py for an complex\nmilter used in production.\n\n[a] This is for a quick test.  Your sendmail.cf in most distros will get\noverwritten whenever sendmail.mc is updated.  To make a milter permanent,\nadd something like:\n```\nINPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`pythonfilter', `S=local:/home/username/pythonsock, F=T, T=C:5m;S:20s;R:5m;E:5m')\n```\nto sendmail.mc instead.\n\n# Not-so-quick Installation\n\nFirst install Sendmail.  Make sure you read libmilter/README in the Sendmail\nsource directory, and make sure you enable libmilter before you build.  The\n8.11 series had libmilter marked as FFR (For Future Release); 8.12\nofficially supports libmilter, but it's still not built by default.\n\nInstall Python, and enable threading in Modules/Setup.\n\nInstall this miltermodule package; DistUtils Automatic Installation:\n\n$ python setup.py --help\n\nFor versions of python prior to 2.0, you will need to download distutils\nseparately or build manually.  You will need to download unittest\nseparately to run the test programs.  The bdist_rpm distutils option seems\nnot to work for python 2.0; upgrade to at least 2.1.1.\n\nNow that everything is installed, we need to tell sendmail that we're going\nto filter incoming email.  Add lines similar to the following to\nsendmail.cf:\n\nO InputMailFilters=pythonfilter\nXpythonfilter,        S=local:/home/username/pythonsock\n\nThe \"O\" line tells sendmail which filters to use in what order; here we're\ntelling sendmail to use the filter named \"pythonfilter\".\n\nThe next line, the \"X\" line (for \"eXternal\"), lists that filter along with\nsome options associated with it.  In this case, we have the \"S\" option, which\nnames the socket that sendmail will use to communicate with this particular\nmilter.  This milter's socket is a unix-domain socket in the filesystem.\nSee libmilter/README for the definitive list of options.\n\nNB: The name is specified in two places: here, in sendmail's cf file, and\nin the milter itself.  Make sure the two match.\n\nNB: The above lines can be added in your .mc file with this line:\n```\nINPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`pythonfilter', `S=local:/home/username/pythonsock')\n```\nFor versions of sendmail prior to 8.12, you will need to enable\n`_FFR_MILTER` for the cf macros.  For example,\n\nm4 -D_FFR_MILTER ../m4/cf.m4 myconfig.mc > myconfig.cf\n\n# IPv6 Notes\n\nThe IPv6 protocol is supported if your operation system supports it\nand if sendmail was compiled with IPv6 support.  To determine if your\nsendmail supports IPv6, run \"sendmail -d0\" and check for the NETINET6\ncompilation option.  To compile sendmail with IPv6 support, add this\ndeclaration to your site.config.m4 before building it:\n```\nAPPENDDEF(`confENVDEF', `-DNETINET6=1')\n```\nIPv6 support can show up in two places; the communications socket\nbetween the milter and sendmail processes and in the host address\nargument to the connect() callback method.\n\nFor sendmail to be able to accept IPv6 SMTP sessions, you must\nconfigure the daemon to listen on an IPv6 port.  Furthermore if you\nwant to allow both IPv4 and IPv6 connections, some operating systems\nwill require that each listens to different port numbers.  For an\nIPv6-only setup, your sendmail configuration should contain a line\nsimilar to (first line is for sendmail.mc, second is sendmail.cf):\n```\nDAEMON_OPTIONS(`Name=MTA-v6, Family=inet6, Modify=C, Port=25')\nO DaemonPortOptions=Name=MTA-v6, Family=inet6, Modify=C, Port=25\n```\nTo allow sendmail and the milter process to communicate with each\nother over IPv6, you may use the \"inet6\" socket name prefix, as in:\n\nXpythonfilter,        S=inet6:1234@fec0:0:0:7::5c\n\nThe connect() callback method in the milter class will pass the\nIPv6-specific information in the 'hostaddr' argument as a tuple.  Note\nthat the type of this value is dependent upon the protocol family, and\nis not compatible with IPv4 connections.  Therefore you should always\ncheck the family argument before attempting to use the hostaddr\nargument.  A quick example showing this follows:\n\n  import socket\n  \n  class ipv6awareMilter(Milter.Milter):\n     \n     def connect(self,hostname,family,hostaddr):\n\tif family==socket.AF_INET:\n\t   ipaddress, port = hostaddr\n\telif family==socket.AF_INET6:\n\t   ip6address, port, flowinfo, scopeid = hostaddr\n\telif family==socket.AF_UNIX:\n\t   socketpath = hostaddr\n\nThe hostname argument is always safe to use without interpreting the\nprotocol family.  For IPv6 connections for which the hostname can not\nbe determined the hostname will appear similar to the string\n\"[IPv6:::1]\" with the corresponding hostaddr[0] being \"::1\".  Refer to\nRFC 2553 for information on interpreting and using the flowinfo and\nscopeid socket attributes, both of which are integers.\n\n# Authors\n\nJim Niemira (urmane@urmane.org) wrote the original C module and some quick\nand dirty python to use it.  Stuart D. Gathman (stuart@gathman.org) took that\nkludge and added threading and context objects to it, wrote a proper OO\nwrapper (Milter.py) that handles attachments, did lots of testing, packaged\nit with distutils, and generally transformed it from a quick hack to a\nreal, usable Python extension.","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":"https://pythonhosted.org/pymilter/","download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://www.pymilter.org/","keywords":"sendmail,milter","license":"GPL","maintainer":"Stuart D.
