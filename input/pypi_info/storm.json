API docs, a manual, and a tutorial are available from:\n\nhttps://storm.canonical.com/\n\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nThe project was in development for more than a year for use in\nCanonical projects such as Launchpad and Landscape before being\nreleased as free software on July 9th, 2007.\n\nDesign:\n\n * Clean and lightweight API offers a short learning curve and\n   long-term maintainability.\n * Storm is developed in a test-driven manner. An untested line of\n   code is considered a bug.\n * Storm needs no special class constructors, nor imperative base\n   classes.\n * Storm is well designed (different classes have very clear\n   boundaries, with small and clean public APIs).\n * Designed from day one to work both with thin relational\n   databases, such as SQLite, and big iron systems like PostgreSQL\n   and MySQL.\n * Storm is easy to debug, since its code is written with a KISS\n   principle, and thus is easy to understand.\n * Designed from day one to work both at the low end, with trivial\n   small databases, and the high end, with applications accessing\n   billion row tables and committing to multiple database backends.\n * It's very easy to write and support backends for Storm (current\n   backends have around 100 lines of code).\n\nFeatures:\n\n * Storm is fast.\n * Storm lets you efficiently access and update large datasets by\n   allowing you to formulate complex queries spanning multiple\n   tables using Python.\n * Storm allows you to fallback to SQL if needed (or if you just\n   prefer), allowing you to mix \"old school\" code and ORM code\n * Storm handles composed primary keys with ease (no need for\n   surrogate keys).\n * Storm doesn't do schema management, and as a result you're free\n   to manage the schema as wanted, and creating classes that work\n   with Storm is clean and simple.\n * Storm works very well connecting to several databases and using\n   the same Python types (or different ones) with all of them.\n * Storm can handle obj.attr = <A SQL expression> assignments, when\n   that's really needed (the expression is executed at INSERT/UPDATE\n   time).\n * Storm handles relationships between objects even before they were\n   added to a database.\n * Storm works well with existing database schemas.\n * Storm will flush changes to the database automatically when\n   needed, so that queries made affect recently modified objects.\n\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nCopyright (C) 2006-2020 Canonical, Ltd.

If not, and for reference, the long version\nis below.\n\n $ dev/ubuntu-deps\n $ echo \"$PWD/** rwk,\" | sudo tee /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.mysqld >/dev/null\n $ sudo aa-enforce /usr/sbin/mysqld\n $ make develop\n $ make check\n\nLONG VERSION:\n\nThe following instructions describe the procedure for setting up a\ndevelopment environment and running the test suite.\n\nInstalling dependencies\n-----------------------\n\nThe following instructions assume that you're using Ubuntu.  The same procedure\nwill probably work without changes on a Debian system and with minimal changes\non a non-Debian-based linux distribution.  In order to run the test suite, and\nexercise all supported backends, you will need to install MySQL and\nPostgreSQL, along with the related Python database drivers:\n\n $ sudo apt-get install \\\n       mysql-server \\\n       postgresql pgbouncer \\\n       build-essential\n\nThese will take a few minutes to download.\n\nThe Python dependencies for running tests can mostly be installed with\napt-get:\n\n $ apt-get install \\\n       python-fixtures python-psycopg2 \\\n       python-testresources python-transaction python-twisted \\\n       python-zope.component python-zope.security\n\nTwo modules - pgbouncer and timeline - are not yet packaged in\nUbuntu. These can be installed from PyPI:\n\n  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pgbouncer\n  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/timeline\n\nAlternatively, dependencies can be downloaded as eggs into the current\ndirectory with:\n\n $ make develop\n\nThis ensures that all dependencies are available, downloading from\nPyPI as appropriate.\n\nDatabase setup\n--------------\n\nMost database setup is done automatically by the test suite.  However,\nUbuntu's default MySQL packaging ships an AppArmor profile that prevents it\nfrom writing to a local data directory.  To allow the test suite to do this,\nyou will need to grant it access, which is most easily done by adding a line\nsuch as this to /etc/apparmor.d/local/usr.sbin.mysqld:\n\n  /path/to/storm/** rwk,\n\nThen reload the profile:\n\n  $ sudo aa-enforce /usr/sbin/mysqld\n\nRunning the tests\n-----------------\n\nFinally, its time to run the tests!  Go into the base directory of\nthe storm branch you want to test, and run:\n\n $ make check\n\nThey'll take a while to run.  All tests should pass: failures mean\nthere's a problem with your environment or a bug in Storm.\n","description_content_type":"text/x-rst","docs_url":null,"download_url":"https://launchpad.net/storm/+download","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://storm.canonical.com","keywords":"","license":"LGPL","maintainer":"Storm
