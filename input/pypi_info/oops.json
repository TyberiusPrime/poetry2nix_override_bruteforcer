An OOPS report is a report\nabout something going wrong in a piece of software... thus, an 'oops' :)\n\nThis core package is rarely used directly: most programs or services that want\nto generate OOPS reports will do so via a framework specific adapter (e.g.\npython-oops_wsgi).\n\nDependencies\n============\n\n* Python 2.6+ or 3.3+\n* pytz (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytz/)\n\nTesting Dependencies\n====================\n\n* subunit (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-subunit) (optional)\n\n* testtools (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/testtools)\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nIn Python, OOPS reports are dicts with some well known keys, but extensible\nsimply by adding as many additional keys asneeded. The only constraint is that\nthe resulting dict must be bson serializable : this is the standard to which\nnew serializers are held. Some existing serializers cannot handle this degree\nof extensability and will ignore additional keys, and/or raise an error on keys\nthey expect but which contain unexpected data.\n\nTypical usage:\n\n* When initializing your script/app/server, create a Config object::\n\n  >>> from oops import Config\n  >>> config = Config()\n\n* New reports will be based on the template report::\n\n  >>> config.template\n  {}\n\n* You can edit the template report (which like all reports is just a dict)::\n\n  >>> config.template['branch_nick'] = 'mybranch'\n  >>> config.template['appname'] = 'demo'\n\n* You can supply a callback (for instance, to capture your process memory usage\nwhen the oops is created, or to override / tweak the information gathered by an\nearlier callback)::\n\n  >>> mycallback = lambda report, context: None\n  >>> config.on_create.append(mycallback)\n\nThe context parameter is also just dict, and is passed to all the on_create\ncallbacks similarly to the report. This is used to support passing information\nto the on_create hooks. For instance, the exc_info key is used to pass in\ninformation about the exception being logged (if one was caught).\n\n* Later on, when something has gone wrong and you want to create an OOPS\nreport::\n\n  >>> report = config.create(context=dict(exc_info=sys.exc_info()))\n  >>> report\n  {'appname': 'demo', 'branch_nick': 'mybranch'}\n\n* And then send it off for storage::\n\n  >>> config.publish(report)\n  []\n\n* Note that publish returns a list - each item in the list is the id allocated\nby the particular repository that recieved the report. (Id allocation is up\nto the repository). Publishers should try to use report['id'] for the id, if it\nis set. This is automatically set to the id returned by the previous publisher.\n\nIf publish returns None, then the report was filtered and not passed to any\npublisher (see the api docs for more information).\n\n  >>> 'id' in report\n  False\n  >>> def demo_publish(report):\n  ...    return ['id 1']\n  >>> config.publisher = demo_publish\n  >>> config.publish(report)\n  ['id 1']\n  >>> report['id']\n  'id 1'\n\n* The pprint_to_stream publisher will print out reports to a stream after\npprinting them. This can be very helpful for interactive use.\n\n* The related project oops_datedir_repo contains a local disk based repository which\ncan be used as a publisher.\n\nMore coming soon.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nEither run setup.py in an environment with all the dependencies available, or\nadd the working directory to your PYTHONPATH.\n\n\nDevelopment\n===========\n\nUpstream development takes place at https://launchpad.net/python-oops.\nTo setup a working area for development, if the dependencies are not\nimmediately available, you can use ./bootstrap.py to create bin/buildout, then\nbin/py to get a python interpreter with the dependencies available.\n\nTo run the tests use the runner of your choice, the test suite is\noops.tests.test_suite.\n\nFor instance::\n\n  $ bin/py -m testtools.run oops.tests.test_suite\n\nAlternative you can use the testr command from testrepository::\n\n  $ testr
