Use `boto3-stubs` package instead for implicit type discovery.\n\n### Emacs\n\n- Install `boto3-stubs` with services you use in your environment: `python -m pip install 'boto3-stubs[s3,ec2]'`\n- Install\n  [use-package](https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package),\n  [lsp](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/),\n  [company](https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode) and\n  [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck) packages\n- Install [lsp-pyright](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-pyright) package\n\n```elisp\n(use-package lsp-pyright\n  :ensure t\n  :hook (python-mode .

It delivers\na drop-in type annotations for you and makes sure that:\n\n- All available `boto3` services are covered.\n- Each public class and method of every `boto3` service gets valid type annotations\n  extracted from the documentation (blame `botocore` docs if types are incorrect).\n- Type annotations include up-to-date documentation.\n- Link to documentation is provided for every method.\n- Code is processed by [black](https://github.com/psf/black)\n  and [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) for readability.\n\n## What's new\n\n### Implemented features\n\n- Fully type annotated `boto3` library\n- `mypy`, `pyright`, `VSCode`, `PyCharm`, `Sublime Text` and `Emacs` compatibility\n- `Client` type annotations for each service\n- `ServiceResource` type annotations for each service\n- `Resource` type annotations for each service\n- `Waiter` type annotations for each service\n- `Paginator` type annotations for each service\n- Generated `TypeDefs` for each service\n- Generated `Literals` for each service\n- Auto discovery of types for `boto3.client` and `boto3.session` calls\n- Auto discovery of types for `session.client` and `session.session` calls\n- Auto discovery of types for `client.get_waiter` and `client.get_paginator` calls\n- Auto discovery of types for `ServiceResource` and `Resource` collections\n\n### Latest changes\n\nBuilder changelog can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/youtype/mypy_boto3_builder/releases).\n\n## Versioning\n\n`botocore-stubs` version is the same as related `botocore` version and follows\n[PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) format.\n\n## Thank you\n\n- [Allie Fitter](https://github.com/alliefitter) for\n  [boto3-type-annotations](https://pypi.org/project/boto3-type-annotations/),\n  this package is based on top of his work\n- [black](https://github.com/psf/black) developers for an awesome formatting tool\n- [Timothy Edmund Crosley](https://github.com/timothycrosley) for\n  [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) and how flexible it is\n- [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) developers for doing all dirty work for us\n- [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) team for the new era of typed Python\n\n## Documentation\n\nAll services type annotations can be found in [boto3-stubs docs](https://youtype.github.io/boto3_stubs_docs/)\n\n## Support and contributing\n\nThis package is auto-generated.
