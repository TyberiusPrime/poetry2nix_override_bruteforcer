Set the `PYPI_REPOSITORY_ALIAS` environment variable for specifying PyPI destination.\n\nCalling tox without parameters will execute the following steps: **cs**, **ann**, **utc** and **report**.\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"","keywords":"framework,asyncio,ingots","license":"Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004 http://www.apache.org/licenses/  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION  1.
