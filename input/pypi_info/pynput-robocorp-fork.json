This might be necessary when integrating with other GUI frameworks\nthat incorporate a main-loop, but when run from a script, this will cause the\nprogram to terminate immediately.\n\n\nThe mouse listener thread\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe listener callbacks are invoked directly from an operating thread on some\nplatforms, notably *Windows*.\n\nThis means that long running procedures and blocking operations should not be\ninvoked from the callback, as this risks freezing input for all processes.\n\nA possible workaround is to just dispatch incoming messages to a queue, and let\na separate thread handle them.\n\n\nHandling mouse listener errors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf a callback handler raises an exception, the listener will be stopped. Since\ncallbacks run in a dedicated thread, the exceptions will not automatically be\nreraised.\n\nTo be notified about callback errors, call ``Thread.join`` on the listener\ninstance::\n\n    from pynput import mouse\n\n    class MyException(Exception): pass\n\n    def on_click(x, y, button, pressed):\n        if button == mouse.Button.left:\n            raise MyException(button)\n\n    # Collect events until released\n    with mouse.Listener(\n            on_click=on_click) as listener:\n        try:\n            listener.join()\n        except MyException as e:\n            print('{0} was clicked'.format(e.args[0]))\n\n\nToggling event listening for the mouse listener\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOnce ``pynput.mouse.Listener.stop`` has been called, the listener cannot be\nrestarted, since listeners are instances of ``threading.Thread``.\n\nIf your application requires toggling listening events, you must either add an\ninternal flag to ignore events when not required, or create a new listener when\nresuming listening.\n\n\nSynchronous event listening for the mouse listener\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo simplify scripting, synchronous event listening is supported through the\nutility class ``pynput.mouse.Events``. This class supports reading single\nevents in a non-blocking fashion, as well as iterating over all events.\n\nTo read a single event, use the following code::\n\n    from pynput import mouse\n\n    # The event listener will be running in this block\n    with mouse.Events() as events:\n        # Block at most one second\n        event = events.get(1.0)\n        if event is None:\n            print('You did not interact with the mouse within one second')\n        else:\n            print('Received event {}'.format(event))\n\nTo iterate over mouse events, use the following code::\n\n    from pynput import mouse\n\n    # The event listener will be running in this block\n    with mouse.Events() as events:\n        for event in events:\n            if event.button == mouse.Button.right:\n                break\n            else:\n                print('Received event {}'.format(event))\n\nPlease note that the iterator method does not support non-blocking operation,\nso it will wait for at least one mouse event.\n\nThe events will be instances of the inner classes found in\n``pynput.mouse.Events``.\n\n\nEnsuring consistent coordinates between listener and controller on Windows\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRecent versions of _Windows_ support running legacy applications scaled when\nthe system scaling has been increased beyond 100%. This allows old applications\nto scale, albeit with a blurry look, and avoids tiny, unusable user interfaces.\n\nThis scaling is unfortunately inconsistently applied to a mouse listener and a\ncontroller: the listener will receive physical coordinates, but the controller\nhas to work with scaled coordinates.\n\nThis can be worked around by telling Windows that your application is DPI\naware. This is a process global setting, so _pynput_ cannot do it\nautomatically. Do enable DPI awareness, run the following code::\n\n   import ctypes\n\n\n   PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE = 2\n\n   ctypes.windll.shcore.SetProcessDpiAwareness(PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE)\n\n\nControlling the keyboard\n------------------------\n\nUse ``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.Controller`` like this::\n\n    from pynput_robocorp.keyboard import Key, Controller\n\n    keyboard = Controller()\n\n    # Press and release space\n    keyboard.press(Key.space)\n    keyboard.release(Key.space)\n\n    # Type a lower case A; this will work even if no key on the\n    # physical keyboard is labelled 'A'\n    keyboard.press('a')\n    keyboard.release('a')\n\n    # Type two upper case As\n    keyboard.press('A')\n    keyboard.release('A')\n    with keyboard.pressed(Key.shift):\n        keyboard.press('a')\n        keyboard.release('a')\n\n    # Type 'Hello World' using the shortcut type method\n    keyboard.type('Hello World')\n\n\nMonitoring the keyboard\n-----------------------\n\nUse ``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.Listener`` like this::\n\n    from pynput import keyboard\n\n    def on_press(key):\n        try:\n            print('alphanumeric key {0} pressed'.format(\n                key.char))\n        except AttributeError:\n            print('special key {0} pressed'.format(\n                key))\n\n    def on_release(key):\n        print('{0} released'.format(\n            key))\n        if key == keyboard.Key.esc:\n            # Stop listener\n            return False\n\n    # Collect events until released\n    with keyboard.Listener(\n            on_press=on_press,\n            on_release=on_release) as listener:\n        listener.join()\n\n    # ...or, in a non-blocking fashion:\n    listener = keyboard.Listener(\n        on_press=on_press,\n        on_release=on_release)\n    listener.start()\n\nA keyboard listener is a ``threading.Thread``, and all callbacks will be\ninvoked from the thread.\n\nCall ``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.Listener.stop`` from anywhere, raise ``StopException``\nor return ``False`` from a callback to stop the listener.\n\nThe ``key`` parameter passed to callbacks is a ``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.Key``, for\nspecial keys, a ``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.KeyCode`` for normal alphanumeric keys, or\njust ``None`` for unknown keys.\n\nWhen using the non-blocking version above, the current thread will continue\nexecuting. This might be necessary when integrating with other GUI frameworks\nthat incorporate a main-loop, but when run from a script, this will cause the\nprogram to terminate immediately.\n\n\nThe keyboard listener thread\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe listener callbacks are invoked directly from an operating thread on some\nplatforms, notably *Windows*.\n\nThis means that long running procedures and blocking operations should not be\ninvoked from the callback, as this risks freezing input for all processes.\n\nA possible workaround is to just dispatch incoming messages to a queue, and let\na separate thread handle them.\n\n\nHandling keyboard listener errors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf a callback handler raises an exception, the listener will be stopped. Since\ncallbacks run in a dedicated thread, the exceptions will not automatically be\nreraised.\n\nTo be notified about callback errors, call ``Thread.join`` on the listener\ninstance::\n\n    from pynput import keyboard\n\n    class MyException(Exception): pass\n\n    def on_press(key):\n        if key == keyboard.Key.esc:\n            raise MyException(key)\n\n    # Collect events until released\n    with keyboard.Listener(\n            on_press=on_press) as listener:\n        try:\n            listener.join()\n        except MyException as e:\n            print('{0} was pressed'.format(e.args[0]))\n\n\nToggling event listening for the keyboard listener\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOnce ``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.Listener.stop`` has been called, the listener cannot be\nrestarted, since listeners are instances of ``threading.Thread``.\n\nIf your application requires toggling listening events, you must either add an\ninternal flag to ignore events when not required, or create a new listener when\nresuming listening.\n\n\nSynchronous event listening for the keyboard listener\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo simplify scripting, synchronous event listening is supported through the\nutility class ``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.Events``. This class supports reading single\nevents in a non-blocking fashion, as well as iterating over all events.\n\nTo read a single event, use the following code::\n\n    from pynput import keyboard\n\n    # The event listener will be running in this block\n    with keyboard.Events() as events:\n        # Block at most one second\n        event = events.get(1.0)\n        if event is None:\n            print('You did not press a key within one second')\n        else:\n            print('Received event {}'.format(event))\n\nTo iterate over keyboard events, use the following code::\n\n    from pynput import keyboard\n\n    # The event listener will be running in this block\n    with keyboard.Events() as events:\n        for event in events:\n            if event.key == keyboard.Key.esc:\n                break\n            else:\n                print('Received event {}'.format(event))\n\nPlease note that the iterator method does not support non-blocking operation,\nso it will wait for at least one keyboard event.\n\nThe events will be instances of the inner classes found in\n``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.Events``.\n\n\nGlobal hotkeys\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA common use case for keyboard monitors is reacting to global hotkeys. Since a\nlistener does not maintain any state, hotkeys involving multiple keys must\nstore this state somewhere.\n\n*pynput* provides the class ``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.HotKey`` for this purpose. It\ncontains two methods to update the state, designed to be easily interoperable\nwith a keyboard listener: ``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.HotKey.press`` and\n``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.HotKey.release`` which can be directly passed as listener\ncallbacks.\n\nThe intended usage is as follows::\n\n    from pynput import keyboard\n\n    def on_activate():\n        print('Global hotkey activated!')\n\n    def for_canonical(f):\n        return lambda k: f(l.canonical(k))\n\n    hotkey = keyboard.HotKey(\n        keyboard.HotKey.parse('<ctrl>+<alt>+h'),\n        on_activate)\n    with keyboard.Listener(\n            on_press=for_canonical(hotkey.press),\n            on_release=for_canonical(hotkey.release)) as l:\n        l.join()\n\nThis will create a hotkey, and then use a listener to update its state. Once\nall the specified keys are pressed simultaneously, ``on_activate`` will be\ninvoked.\n\nNote that keys are passed through ``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.Listener.canonical`` before\nbeing passed to the ``HotKey`` instance. This is to remove any modifier state\nfrom the key events, and to normalise modifiers with more than one physical\nbutton.\n\nThe method ``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.HotKey.parse`` is a convenience function to\ntransform shortcut strings to key collections. Please see its documentation for\nmore information.\n\nTo register a number of global hotkeys, use the convenience class\n``pynput_robocorp.keyboard.GlobalHotKeys``::\n\n    from pynput import keyboard\n\n    def on_activate_h():\n        print('<ctrl>+<alt>+h pressed')\n\n    def on_activate_i():\n        print('<ctrl>+<alt>+i pressed')\n\n    with keyboard.GlobalHotKeys({\n            '<ctrl>+<alt>+h': on_activate_h,\n            '<ctrl>+<alt>+i': on_activate_i}) as h:\n        h.join()\n\n\nRelease Notes\n=============\n\nv5.0.0 (2022-12-29) - Upstream updates\n--------------------------------------\n*  Adds upstream v1.7.6 fixes.\n*  Using make-release script.\n\nv1.7.6 (2022-01-01) - Various fixes\n-----------------------------------\n*  Allow passing virtual key codes to the parser for global hot keys.\n*  Stop the recording context asynchronously on *Xorg*.\n*  Do not pass ``None`` to ``objc.objc_object``.

This changes the\n   API, as joining a listener now potentially raises unhandled exceptions,\n   and unhandled exceptions will stop listeners.\n*  Added support for the numeric keypad on *Linux*.\n*  Improved documentation.\n*  Thanks to *jollysean* and *gilleswijnker* for their input!\n\n\nv1.1.7 (2017-01-02) - Handle middle button on Windows\n-----------------------------------------------------\n*  Listen for and dispatch middle button mouse clicks on *Windows*.\n\n\nv1.1.6 (2016-11-24) - Corrected context manager for pressing keys\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n*  Corrected bug in ``pynput.keyboard.Controller.pressed`` which caused it to\n   never release the key. Many thanks to Toby Southwell!\n\n\nv1.1.5 (2016-11-17) - Corrected modifier key combinations on Linux\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n*  Corrected handling of modifier keys to allow them to be composable on\n   *Linux*.\n\n\nv1.1.4 (2016-10-30) - Small bugfixes\n------------------------------------\n*  Corrected error generation when ``GetKeyboardState`` fails.\n*  Make sure to apply shift state to borrowed keys on *X*.\n*  Use *pylint*.\n\n\nv1.1.3 (2016-09-27) - Changed Xlib backend library\n--------------------------------------------------\n*  Changed *Xlib* library.\n\n\nv1.1.2 (2016-09-26) - Added missing type for Python 2\n-----------------------------------------------------\n*  Added missing ``LPDWORD`` for *Python 2* on *Windows*.\n\n\nv1.1.1 (2016-09-26) - Fixes for listeners and controllers on Windows\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n*  Corrected keyboard listener on *Windows*. Modifier keys and other keys\n   changing the state of the keyboard are now handled correctly.\n*  Corrected mouse click and release on *Windows*.\n*  Corrected code samples.\n\n\nv1.1 (2016-06-22) - Simplified usage on Linux\n---------------------------------------------\n*  Propagate import errors raised on Linux to help troubleshoot missing\n   ``Xlib`` module.\n*  Declare ``python3-xlib`` as dependency on *Linux* for *Python 3*.\n\n\nv1.0.6 (2016-04-19) - Universal wheel\n-------------------------------------\n*  Make sure to build a universal wheel for all python versions.\n\n\nv1.0.5 (2016-04-11) - Fixes for dragging on OSX\n-----------------------------------------------\n*  Corrected dragging on *OSX*.\n*  Added scroll speed constant for *OSX* to correct slow scroll speed.\n\n\nv1.0.4 (2016-04-11) - Fixes for clicking and scrolling on Windows\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n*  Corrected name of mouse input field when sending click and scroll events.\n\n\nv1.0.3 (2016-04-05) - Fixes for Python 3 on Windows\n---------------------------------------------------\n*  Corrected use of ``ctypes`` on Windows.\n\n\nv1.0.2 (2016-04-03) - Fixes for thread identifiers\n--------------------------------------------------\n*  Use thread identifiers to identify threads, not Thread instances.\n\n\nv1.0.1 (2016-04-03) - Fixes for Python 3\n----------------------------------------\n*  Corrected bugs which prevented the library from being used on *Python 3*.\n\n\nv1.0 (2016-02-28) - Stable Release\n----------------------------------\n*  Changed license to *LGPL*.\n*  Corrected minor bugs and inconsistencies.\n*  Corrected and extended documentation.\n\n\nv0.6 (2016-02-08) - Keyboard Monitor\n------------------------------------\n*  Added support for monitoring the keyboard.\n*  Corrected wheel packaging.\n*  Corrected deadlock when stopping a listener in some cases on *X*.\n*  Corrected key code constants on *Mac OSX*.\n*  Do not intercept events on *Mac OSX*.\n\n\nv0.5.1 (2016-01-26) - Do not die on dead keys\n---------------------------------------------\n*  Corrected handling of dead keys.\n*  Corrected documentation.\n\n\nv0.5 (2016-01-18) - Keyboard Modifiers\n--------------------------------------\n*  Added support for modifiers.\n\n\nv0.4 (2015-12-22) -
