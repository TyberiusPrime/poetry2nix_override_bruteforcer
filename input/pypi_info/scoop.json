Its documentation is available on http://scoop.readthedocs.org/ .\r\n\r\nPhilosophy\r\n==========\r\n\r\nSCOOP was designed from the following ideas:\r\n\r\n  * The **future** is parallel;\r\n  * Simple is beautiful;\r\n  * Parallelism should be simpler.\r\n    \r\nThese tenets are translated concretely in a **minimum number of functions** \r\nallowing **maximum parallel efficiency** while keeping at **minimum the \r\ninner knowledge required** to use them. It is implemented with Python 3 in mind \r\nwhile being compatible with Python 2.6+ to allow fast prototyping without sacrificing \r\nefficiency and speed.\r\n\r\nSome comments we received on SCOOP:\r\n\r\n  * \"I must say that that was by far the easiest upgrade I have probably ever done.  I still need to build and test it on the cluster, but on my development machine it took about 10 minutes to upgrade and test.\" [deap mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/deap-users/chQY-2HHZWM/4qZRkQuvbbIJ EBo)\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\nSCOOP features and advantages over \r\n[futures](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/concurrent.futures.html),\r\n[multiprocessing](http://docs.python.org/dev/library/multiprocessing.html)\r\nand similar modules are as follows:\r\n\r\n  * Harness the power of **multiple computers** over network;\r\n  * Ability to spawn multiple tasks inside a task;\r\n  * API compatible with [PEP-3148](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3148/);\r\n  * Parallelizing serial code with only minor modifications;\r\n  * Efficient load-balancing.\r\n\r\nAnatomy of a SCOOPed program\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nSCOOP can handle multiple diversified multi-layered tasks. With it, you can submit your different functions and data simultaneously and effortlessly while the framework executes them locally or remotely. Contrarily to most multiprocessing frameworks, it allows to launch subtasks within tasks.\r\n\r\n![Intro tree](http://scoop.readthedocs.org/en/latest/_images/introductory_tree.png)\r\n\r\nThrough SCOOP, you can execute simultaneously tasks that are different by \r\nnature, shown by the task color, or different by complexity, shown by the task radius. The module will handle the physical considerations of parallelization, such as task distribution over your resources (load balancing), communications, etc.\r\n\r\nApplications\r\n------------\r\n\r\nThe common applications of SCOOP consist but is not limited to:\r\n\r\n  * Evolutionary Algorithms\r\n  * Monte Carlo simulations\r\n  * Data mining\r\n  * Data processing\r\n  * Graph traversal\r\n\r\nCiting SCOOP\r\n============\r\n\r\nAuthors of scientific papers including results generated using SCOOP are encouraged to cite the following
