`L` is the Cholesky factor of a covariance matrix with off-diagonal elements\n    x = pm.MvNormal(\"x\", mu=np.zeros(L.shape[0]), chol=L, shape=L.shape[0])\n    y = pm.Normal(\"y\", shape=5)\n\n    trace = pmx.sample(\n        parameter_groups=[\n            [x],\n            pmx.sampling.ParameterGroup([y], \"diag\"),\n        ],\n    )\n```\n\n### Variable target acceptance fraction (experimental)\n\nThe `pmx.sample` function also includes support for an experimental feature where the target acceptance fraction is adjusted throughout the tuning phase.\nThis can be useful when the early warm up windows are slow to run because a high target acceptance fraction will require tiny step sizes that aren't well suited for searching for the typical set.\nThis feature can be used by providing the `initial_accept` parameter (usually set to something like `0.5`) to `pmx.sample`.\nThis will be the target acceptance fraction at the beginning and it will be increased to `target_accept` (`0.9` by default) throught the tuning phase.\n\n## Optimization\n\nWhen PyMC3 added a warning to the `pm.find_MAP` function, we implemented a custom non-linear optimization framework in `exoplanet` because it is often useful to be able to optimize (at least) some parameters when initializing the sampler for many problems in astrophysics (and probably elsewhere).\nWhile `pm.find_MAP` no longer complains, the `pymc3_ext.optimize` function is included here for backwards compatibility even though it should have similar behavior to `pm.find_MAP`.\nTo use this function, you'll do something like the following:\n\n```python\nimport pymc3_ext as pmx\n\nwith model:\n    soln = pmx.optimize(vars=[var1, var2])\n    soln = pmx.optimize(start=soln, vars=[var3])\n```\n\n## Distributions\n\nMost of the custom distributions in this library are there to make working with periodic parameters (like angles) easier.\nAll of these reparameterizations could be implemented manually without too much trouble, but it can be useful to have them in a more compact form.\nHere is a list of the included distributions and a short description:\n\n- `pmx.UnitVector`: A vector where the sum of squares is fixed to unity. For a multidimensional shape, the normalization is performed along the last dimension.\n- `pmx.UnitDisk`: Two dimensional parameters constrianed to live within the unit disk. This will be useful when you have an angle and a magnitude that must be in the range zero to one (for example, an eccentricity vector for a bound orbit). This distribution is constrained such that the sum of squares along the zeroth axis will always be less than one. Note that the shape of this distribution must be two in the zeroth axis.\n- `pmx.Angle`: An angle constrained to be in the range -pi to pi. The actual sampling is performed in the two dimensional vector space `(sin(theta), cos(theta))` so that the sampler doesn't see a discontinuity at pi. As a technical detail, the performance of this distribution can be affected using the `regularization` parameter which helps deal with pathelogical geometries introduced when this parameter is well/poorly constrained. The default value (`10.0`) was selected as a reasonable default choice, but you might get better performance by adjusting this.\n- `pmx.Periodic`: An extension to `pmx.Angle` that supports arbitrary upper and lower bounds for the allowed range.\n- `pmx.UnitUniform`: This distribution is equivalent to `pm.Uniform(lower=0, upper=1)`, but it can be more numerically stable in some cases.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2020 Dan Foreman-Mackey and contributors.\n\npymc3-ext is free software made available under the MIT License.
