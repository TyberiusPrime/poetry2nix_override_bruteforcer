You can install it using `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install empyrical-reloaded\n```\n\nor `conda` from the `conda-forge` channel\n\n```bash\nconda install empyrical-reloaded -c conda-forge\n```\n\nempyrical requires and installs the following packages while executing the above commands:\n\n- numpy>=1.9.2\n- pandas>=1.0.0\n- scipy>=0.15.1\n\nOptional dependencies include [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) to download price data\nfrom [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/)\nand [pandas-datareader](https://pandas-datareader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to\naccess [Fama-French](https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data_library.html) risk factors and FRED\ntreasury yields.\n\n> Note that `pandas-datareader` is not compatible with Python>=3.12.\n\nTo install the optional dependencies, use:\n\n```bash\npip install empyrical-reloaded[yfinance]\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\npip install empyrical-reloaded[datreader]\n```\n\nor\n\n```bash\npip install empyrical-reloaded[yfinance,datreader]\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Simple Statistics\n\nEmpyrical computes basic metrics from returns and volatility to alpha and beta, Value at Risk, and Shorpe or Sortino\nratios.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom empyrical import max_drawdown, alpha_beta\n\nreturns = np.array([.01, .02, .03, -.4, -.06, -.02])\nbenchmark_returns = np.array([.02, .02, .03, -.35, -.05, -.01])\n\n# calculate the max drawdown\nmax_drawdown(returns)\n\n# calculate alpha and beta\nalpha, beta = alpha_beta(returns, benchmark_returns)\n```\n\n### Rolling Measures\n\nEmpyrical also aggregates return and risk metrics for rolling windows:\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom empyrical import roll_max_drawdown\n\nreturns = np.array([.01, .02, .03, -.4, -.06, -.02])\n\n# calculate the rolling max drawdown\nroll_max_drawdown(returns, window=3)\n```\n\n### Pandas Support\n\nEmpyrical also works with both [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) arrays and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data\nstructures:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom empyrical import roll_up_capture, capture\n\nreturns = pd.Series([.01, .02, .03, -.4, -.06, -.02])\nfactor_returns = pd.Series([.02, .01, .03, -.01, -.02, .02])\n\n# calculate a capture ratio\ncapture(returns, factor_returns)\n-0.147387712263491\n\n```\n\n### Fama-French Risk Factors\n\nEmpyrical downloads Fama-French risk factors from 1970 onward:\n\n> Note: requires optional dependency `pandas-datareader` - see installation instructions above.gst\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport empyrical as emp\n\nrisk_factors = emp.utils.get_fama_french()\n\npd.concat([risk_factors.head(), risk_factors.tail()])\n\n                           Mkt-RF     SMB     HML       RF     Mom\nDate\n1970-01-02 00:00:00+00:00  0.0118  0.0129  0.0101  0.00029 -0.0340\n1970-01-05 00:00:00+00:00  0.0059  0.0067  0.0072  0.00029 -0.0153\n1970-01-06 00:00:00+00:00 -0.0074  0.0010  0.0021  0.00029  0.0038\n1970-01-07 00:00:00+00:00 -0.0015  0.0040 -0.0033  0.00029  0.0011\n1970-01-08 00:00:00+00:00  0.0004  0.0018 -0.0017  0.00029  0.0033\n2024-03-22 00:00:00+00:00 -0.0023 -0.0087 -0.0053  0.00021  0.0043\n2024-03-25 00:00:00+00:00 -0.0026 -0.0024  0.0088  0.00021 -0.0034\n2024-03-26 00:00:00+00:00 -0.0026  0.0009 -0.0013  0.00021  0.0009\n2024-03-27 00:00:00+00:00  0.0088  0.0104  0.0091  0.00021 -0.0134\n2024-03-28 00:00:00+00:00  0.0010  0.0029  0.0048  0.00021 -0.0044\n```\n\n### Asset Prices and Benchmark Returns\n\nEmpyrical use [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance) to download price data\nfrom [Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/). To obtain the S&P returns since 1950, use:\n\n> Note: requires optional dependency `yfinance` - see installation instructions above.\n\n```python\nimport empyrical as emp\n\nsymbol = '^GSPC'\nreturns = emp.utils.get_symbol_returns_from_yahoo(symbol,\n                                                  start='1950-01-01')\n\nimport seaborn as sns  # requires separate installation\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # requires separate installation\n\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(14, 5))\n\nwith sns.axes_style('whitegrid'):\n    returns.plot(ax=axes[0], rot=0, title='Time Series', legend=False)\n    sns.histplot(returns, ax=axes[1], legend=False)\naxes[1].set_title('Histogram')\nsns.despine()\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.suptitle('Daily S&P 500 Returns')\n```\n\n<a href=\"https://empyrical.ml4trading.io\">\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/0PSxfSI.png\" width=\"100%\">\n</a>\n\n### Documentation\n\nSee the [documentation](https://empyrical.ml4trading.io) for details on the API.\n\n## Support\n\nPlease [open an issue](https://github.com/stefan-jansen/empyrical-reloaded/issues/new) for support.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease contribute using [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).
