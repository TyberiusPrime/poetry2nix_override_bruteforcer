It becomes possible to build simple grammars on top of\nexisting Pygments lexers to perform lightweight parsing of the many (130+)\nprogramming languages supported by Pygments.\n\nThe parsing task transforms a sequence of Tokens in a parse Tree where each node\nin the tree is recognized and assigned a label. Parsing is using regular\nexpression-based grammar rules applied to recognize Token sequences.\n\nThese rules are evaluated sequentially and not recursively: this keeps things\nsimple and works very well in practice. This approach and the rules syntax has\nbeen battle-tested with NLTK from which pygmars is derived.\n\n\nWhat about the name?\n-----------------------\n\n\"pygmars\" is a portmanteau of Pyg-ments and Gram-mars.\n\n\nOrigins\n--------\n\nThis library is based on heavily modified, simplified and remixed original code\nfrom NLTK regex POS tagger (renamed lexer) and regex chunker (renamed parser).\nThe original usage of NLTK was designed by @savinosto parse copyrights statements\nin ScanCode Toolkit.\n\n\nUsers\n-------\n\npygmars is used by ScanCode Toolkit for copyright detection and for\nlightweight programming language parsing.\n\n\nWhy pygmars?\n--------------\n\nWhy create this seemingly redundant library? Why not use NLTK directly?\n\n- NLTK has a specific focus on NLP and lexing/tagging and parsing using regexes\n  is a tiny part of its overall feature set. These are part of rich set of\n  taggers and parsers and implement a common API. We do not have the need for\n  these richer APIs and they make evolving the API and refactoring the code\n  difficult.\n\n- In particular NLTK POS tagging and chunking has been the engine used in\n  ScanCode toolkit copyright and author detection and there are some\n  improvements, simplifications and optimizations that would be difficult to\n  implement in NLTK directly and unlikely to be accepted upstream. For instance,\n  simplification of the code subset used for copyright detection enabled a big\n  boost in performance. Improvements to track the Token lines and positions may\n  not have been possible within the NLTK API.\n\n- Newer versions of NLTK have several extra required dependencies that we do\n  not need. This is turn makes every tool heavier and complex when they only use\n  this limited NLTK subset. By stripping unused NLTK code, we get a small and\n  focused library with no dependencies.\n\n- ScanCode toolkit also needs lightweight parsing of several programming\n  languages to extract metadata (such as dependencies) from package manifests.\n  Some parsers have been built by hand (such as gemfileparser), or use the\n  Python ast module (for Python setup.py), or they use existing Pygments lexers\n  as a base. A goal of this library is to be enable building lightweight parsers\n  reusing a Pygments lexer output as an input for a grammar. This is fairly\n  different from NLP in terms of goals.\n\n\nTheory of operations\n---------------------\n\nA ``pygmars.lex.Lexer`` creates a sequence of ``pygmars.Token`` objects\nsuch as::\n\n    Token(value=\"for\" label=\"KEYWORD\", start_line=12, pos=4)\n\nwhere the label is a symbol name assigned to this token.\n\nA Token is a terminal symbol and the grammar is composed of rules where the left\nhand side is a label aka. a non-terminal symbol and  the right hand side is a\nregular expression-like pattern over labels.\n\nSee https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_and_nonterminal_symbols\n\nA ``pygmars.parse.Parser`` is built from a ``pygmars.parse.Grammmar`` and\ncalling its ``parse`` function transforms a sequence of Tokens in a\n``pygmars.tree.Tree`` parse tree.\n\nThe grammar is composed of Rules and loaded from a text with one rule per line\nsuch as::\n\n    ASSIGNMENT: {<VARNAME> <EQUAL> <STRING|INT|FLOAT>} # variable assignment\n\n\nHere the left hand side \"ASSIGNMENT\" label is produced when the right hand side\nsequence of Token labels \"<VARNAME> <EQUAL> <STRING|INT|FLOAT>\" is matched.\n\"# variable assignment\" is kept as a description for this rule.\n\n\nLicense\n--------\n\n- SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n\nBased on a substantially modified subset of the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)\nhttp://nltk.org/\n\nCopyright (c) nexB Inc. and others.\nCopyright (C) NLTK Project\n","description_content_type":"text/x-rst","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/nexB/pygmars","keywords":"utilities","license":"Apache-2.0","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"pygmars","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/pygmars/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/pygmars/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://github.com/nexB/pygmars"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/pygmars/0.8.0/","requires_dist":["Sphinx (>=3.3.1) ; extra == 'docs'","sphinx-rtd-theme (>=0.5.0) ; extra == 'docs'","doc8 (>=0.8.1) ; extra == 'docs'","pytest (!=7.0.0,>=6) ; extra == 'testing'","pytest-xdist (>=2) ; extra == 'testing'","aboutcode-toolkit (>=6.0.0) ; extra == 'testing'","black ; extra == 'testing'"],"requires_python":">=3.6.*","summary":"Craft simple regex-based small language lexers and parsers.
