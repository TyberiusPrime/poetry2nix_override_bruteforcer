It is intended to be customized for specific hardware, observational, and data reduction requirements.\n\nOperation is based on the concept of *tools* which are the interfaces to both hardware and software code.  Examples of tools are *instrument* which controls instrument hardware, *telescope* which interfaces to a telescope, *linearity* which acquires and analyzes images to determine sensor linearity, and *exposure* which controls a scientific observation by interfacing with a variety of other tools. As an example, the *exposure* tool may move a telescope and multiple filter wheels, control a camera shutter, operate the camera by taking an exposure, display the resultant image, and begin data reduction of that image.\n\nAzCam is not appropriate for consumer-level cameras and is not intended to have a common API across all systems. It's primary design principle is to allow interfacing to a wide variety of custom instrumentation which is required to acquire and analyze scientific image data.\n\nThe *azcam* python package currently supports Astronomical Research Cameras, Inc. Gen3, Gen2, and Gen1 CCD controllers, Magellan Guider controllers, STA Archon controllers, and CMOS cameras using ASCOM. It also supports a variety of temperature controollers, telecopes, and image displays.\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee https://azcam.readthedocs.io.\n\nSee also https://github.com/mplesser/azcam-tool.git for the standard GUI used by most telescope observers.\n\n## Installation\n\n`pip install azcam`\n\nOr download the latest version from from github:
