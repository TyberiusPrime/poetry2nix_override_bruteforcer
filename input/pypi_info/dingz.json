For questions and other inquiries, use the issue tracker in this\nrepository please.\n\nWithout the support of iolo AG and myStrom AG it would have taken much longer\nto create this module which is the base for the integration into\n`Home Assistant <https://home-assistant.io>`_. Both companies have provided\nand are still providing hardware, valuable feedback and advice. Their\ncontinuous support make further development of this module possible.\n\nSee `api.dingz.ch <https://api.dingz.ch/>`_ for the API details.\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\nThis module is at the moment limited to consuming sensor data, device details,\ndevice configurations and states.\nThe front LED can be controlled but buttons requires you to programm them by\nyourself.\n\nNo support for setting timers and schedules.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nYou need to have `Python 3 <https://www.python.org>`_ installed.\n\n- `dingz <https://dingz.ch>`_ device\n- Network connection\n- Devices connected to your network\n\nYou need to know the IP address of the devices. Please consult your router\ndocumentation to get this information or use the `dingz` CLI tool.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nThe package is available in the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/>`_ .\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ pip install dingz\n\nOn a Fedora-based system or on a CentOS/RHEL machine which has EPEL enabled.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    $ sudo dnf -y install python3-dingz\n\nModule usage\n------------\n\nEvery unit has its own web interface: `http://IP_ADDRESS <http://IP_ADDRESS>`_ .\n\nSee `example.py` for detail about module.\n\n\nHow to operate shades / dimmers\n-------------------------------\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    d = Dingz(\"ip_address_or_host\")\n    # Fetch config, this has to be done once to fetch all details about the shades/dimmers\n    await d.get_devices_config()\n\n    # Fetch the current state of the lights/vers\n    await d.get_state()\n\n    # Get details about shade\n    shade_0 = d.shades.get(0)\n    print(\"Blinds: %s Lamella: %s\" % (shade_0.current_blind_level(), shade_0.current_lamella_level()))\n\n    # Operate shade\n    shade_0.shade_down()\n\n    # Turn on light\n    d.dimmers.get(2).turn_on(brightness_pct=70)\n\n\nCLI usage\n---------\n\nThe package contains a command-line tool which support some basic tasks.\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n   $ dingz discover\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n``python-dingz`` is licensed under ASL 2.0, for more details check LICENSE.\n\n\n","description_content_type":"","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/home-assistant-ecosystem/python-dingz","keywords":"","license":"Apache License 2.0","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"dingz","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/dingz/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/dingz/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://github.com/home-assistant-ecosystem/python-dingz"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/dingz/0.5.0/","requires_dist":["aiohttp (<4)","async-timeout (<5)","click","setuptools"],"requires_python":">=3.8","summary":"Python API for interacting with Dingz devices","version":"0.5.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":12195119,"releases":{"0.5.0":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"9ddf3e1db297f09e1bdea7655f05c8ea38eaa083af7ec57de4ac45b13533b7d1","md5":"89aff5bc778823c9dc155a5e68e943aa","sha256":"1f2c48c24c45243f83cb51f1b2b25f5ffac4a06af55de0c6de3d6f52209be3e4"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"dingz-0.5.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"89aff5bc778823c9dc155a5e68e943aa","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.8","size":18055,"upload_time":"2021-12-02T22:17:19","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-12-02T22:17:19.817276Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/9d/df/3e1db297f09e1bdea7655f05c8ea38eaa083af7ec57de4ac45b13533b7d1/dingz-0.5.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"de9d16d017e1b9f4d1318ffec7f23c5faed55229371c51935e8bf44173964663","md5":"7c263e25e5395ea347dfca323a384ced","sha256":"6aeea86a1302be018b9f12eed4011ecf3cac9712c2c1e7f0fe1ceeab51aff067"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"dingz-0.5.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"7c263e25e5395ea347dfca323a384ced","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.8","size":16578,"upload_time":"2021-12-02T22:17:23","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-12-02T22:17:23.664111Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/de/9d/16d017e1b9f4d1318ffec7f23c5faed55229371c51935e8bf44173964663/dingz-0.5.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"9ddf3e1db297f09e1bdea7655f05c8ea38eaa083af7ec57de4ac45b13533b7d1","md5":"89aff5bc778823c9dc155a5e68e943aa","sha256":"1f2c48c24c45243f83cb51f1b2b25f5ffac4a06af55de0c6de3d6f52209be3e4"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"dingz-0.5.0-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"89aff5bc778823c9dc155a5e68e943aa","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.8","size":18055,"upload_time":"2021-12-02T22:17:19","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-12-02T22:17:19.817276Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/9d/df/3e1db297f09e1bdea7655f05c8ea38eaa083af7ec57de4ac45b13533b7d1/dingz-0.5.0-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"de9d16d017e1b9f4d1318ffec7f23c5faed55229371c51935e8bf44173964663","md5":"7c263e25e5395ea347dfca323a384ced","sha256":"6aeea86a1302be018b9f12eed4011ecf3cac9712c2c1e7f0fe1ceeab51aff067"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"dingz-0.5.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"7c263e25e5395ea347dfca323a384ced","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.8","size":16578,"upload_time":"2021-12-02T22:17:23","upload_time_iso_8601":"2021-12-02T22:17:23.664111Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/de/9d/16d017e1b9f4d1318ffec7f23c5faed55229371c51935e8bf44173964663/dingz-0.5.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
