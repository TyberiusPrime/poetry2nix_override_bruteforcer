It also\nprovides integration with Git.\n\nFor detailed information about the EB CLI, see `Using the Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI) <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb-cli3.html>`__\nin the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide*.\n\nThe EB CLI is now an open source project, hosted in this repository.\nYou're welcome to participate by reporting issues, making suggestions, and submitting pull requests.\nWe value your contributions!\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n-------------------------------\nIf you'd like to use the EB CLI\n-------------------------------\n\nThe easiest and recommended way to install the EB CLI is to use the EB CLI setup scripts available on a separate GitHub repository.\nUse the scripts to install the EB CLI on Linux, macOS, or Windows. The scripts install the EB CLI and its dependencies, including Python and pip.\nThe scripts also create a virtual environment for the EB CLI.\nFor installation instructions, see the `aws/aws-elastic-beanstalk-cli-setup <https://github.com/aws/aws-elastic-beanstalk-cli-setup>`__ repository. \n\n-----------------------------------------\nIf you'd like to contribute to the EB CLI\n-----------------------------------------\n\nDependencies\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nInstall Python and Pip. The most recent version of Python now includes pip.\n\nTo install Python, go `here <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__.\n\nIf you already have Python, but need to install Pip, go `here <https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html>`__.\n\nInstall the EB CLI from this repository\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nYou need administrator/sudo privileges unless you install into a virtual environment.\n\nTo install the EB CLI\n\n1. Clone or download this repository to your local environment.\n\n2. Navigate to the the root of the repository.\n\n3. Run the following command.\n   \n   `pip install .`:code:\n\nGetting Started\n===============\n\nThe EB CLI requires you to have AWS security credentials.\nTo learn how to get security credentials, see `Managing Access Keys for Your AWS Account Root User <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/managing-aws-access-keys.html>`__\nin the *AWS General Reference*.\n\nTo view a list of EB CLI commands, type:\n\n    eb --help\n\nFor more information about a specific command, type:\n\n    eb {cmd} --help\n\nFor a detailed command reference for all EB CLI commands, see `EB CLI Command Reference <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/eb3-cmd-commands.html>`__\nin the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide*.\n\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n--------------------\n3.20.10
