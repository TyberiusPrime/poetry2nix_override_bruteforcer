(see for example the `reference configuration file`_)\n- filter out commits/tags based on regexp matching\n- refactor commit summary, or commit body on the fly with replace regexp\n- classify commit message into sections (ie: New, Fix, Changes...)\n- any output format supported thanks to templating, you can even choose\n  your own preferred template engine (mako, mustache, full python ...).\n- support your merge or rebase workflows and complicated git histories\n- support full or incremental changelog generation to match your needs.\n- support easy access to `trailers key values`_ (if you use them)\n- support of multi-authors for one commit through ``Co-Authored-By`` `trailers key values`_\n- support standard python installation or dep-free single executable.\n  (this last feature is not yet completely pain free to use on Windows)\n\n.. _trailers key values: https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/CommitMessageConventions\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n``gitchangelog`` is compatible Python 2 and Python 3 on\nLinux/BSD/MacOSX and Windows.\n\nPlease submit an issue if you encounter incompatibilities.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n\nfull package\n------------\n\nGitchangelog is published on PyPI, thus:\n\n    pip install gitchangelog\n\n\\.. is the way to go for install the full package on any platform.\n\nIf you are installing from source, please note that the development tools\nare not working fully yet on Windows.\n\nThe full package provides the ``gitchangelog.py`` executable as long as:\n\n- a `reference configuration file`_ that provides system wide defaults for\n  all values.\n- some example templates in ``mustache`` and ``mako`` templating\n  engine's language. Ideal to bootstrap your variations.\n\n\nfrom source\n-----------\n\nIf you'd rather work from the source repository, it supports the common\nidiom to install it on your system::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\nNote that for linux/BSD, there's a link to the executable in the root of the\nsource. This can be a convenient way to work on the source version.\n\n\nsingle executable installation\n------------------------------\n\nThe file ``gitchangelog.py`` is a full blown executable and can be used\nwithout any other files. This is easier to use naturally on Linux/BSD\nsystems. For instance, you could type in::\n\n    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaab/gitchangelog/master/src/gitchangelog/gitchangelog.py > /usr/local/bin/gitchangelog &&\n    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/gitchangelog\n\nIt'll install ``gitchangelog`` to be accessible for all users and will\nuse the default python interpreter of your running session.\n\nPlease note: if you choose to install it in this standalone mode, then\nyou must make sure to value at least all the required configuration\nkeys in your config file. As a good start you should probably copy the\n`reference configuration file`_ as you base configuration file.\n\nThis is due to the fact that ``gitchangelog`` can not anymore reach\nthe reference configuration file to get default values.\n\n\nSample\n======\n\nThe default output is ReSTructured text, so it should be readable in ASCII.\n\nHere is a small sample of the ``gitchangelog`` changelog at work.\n\nCurrent ``git log`` output so you can get an idea of the log history::\n\n  * 59f902a Valentin Lab new: dev: sections in changelog are now in the order given in ``gitchangelog.rc`` in the ``section_regexps`` option.  (0.1.2)\n  * c6f72cc Valentin Lab chg: dev: commented code to toggle doctest mode.\n  * a9c38f3 Valentin Lab fix: dev: doctests were failing on this.\n  * 59524e6 Valentin Lab new: usr: added ``body_split_regexp`` option to attempts to format correctly body of commit.\n  * 5883f07 Valentin Lab new: usr: use a list of tuple instead of a dict for ``section_regexps`` to be able to manage order between section on find match.\n  * 7c1d480 Valentin Lab new: dev: new ``unreleased_version_label`` option in ``gitchangelog.rc`` to change label of not yet released code.\n  * cf29c9c Valentin Lab fix: dev: bad sorting of tags (alphanumerical).

(0.1.1)\n  * 0c66d59 Valentin Lab fix: dev: Fixed case where exception was thrown if two tags are on the same commit.\n  * d2fae0d Valentin Lab new: usr: added a succint ``--help`` support.\n\nAnd here is the ``gitchangelog`` output::\n\n  0.1.2 (2011-05-17)\n  ------------------\n\n  New\n  ~~~\n  - Sections in changelog are now in the order given in ``git-\n    changelog.rc`` in the ``section_regexps`` option. [Valentin Lab]\n  - Added ``body_split_regexp`` option to attempts to format correctly\n    body of commit. [Valentin Lab]\n  - Use a list of tuple instead of a dict for ``section_regexps`` to be\n    able to manage order between section on find match.

[Valentin Lab]\n  - Cosmetic removal of trailing whitespaces. [Valentin Lab]\n\n  Fix\n  ~~~\n  - Doctests were failing on this. [Valentin Lab]\n  - Bad sorting of tags (alphanumerical). Changed to commit date sort.\n    [Valentin Lab]\n  - Support of empty commit message. [Valentin Lab]\n  - ``git`` in later versions seems to fail on ``git config <key>`` with\n    errlvl 255, that was not supported. [Valentin Lab]\n  - Removed Traceback when there were no tags at all in the current git\n    repository. [Valentin Lab]\n\n\n  0.1.1 (2011-04-07)\n  ------------------\n\n  New\n  ~~~\n  - Added section classifiers (ie: New, Change, Bugs) and updated the\n    sample rc file.

[Valentin Lab]\n\nAnd the rendered full result is directly used to generate the HTML webpage of\nthe `changelog of the PyPI page`_.\n\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThe `reference configuration file`_ is delivered within\n``gitchangelog`` package and is used to provides defaults to\nsettings. If you didn't install the package and used the standalone\nfile, then chances are that ``gitchangelog`` can't access these\ndefaults values. This is not a problem as long as you provided all the\nrequired values in your config file.\n\nThe recommended location for ``gitchangelog`` config file is the root\nof the current git repository with the name ``.gitchangelog.rc``.\nHowever you could put it elsewhere, and here are the locations checked\n(first match will prevail):\n\n- in the path given thanks to the environment variable\n  ``GITCHANGELOG_CONFIG_FILENAME``\n- in the path stored in git config's entry ``gitchangelog.rc-path`` (which\n  could be stored in system location or per repository)\n- (RECOMMENDED) in the root of the current git repository with the name\n  ``.gitchangelog.rc``\n\nThen, you'll be able to call ``gitchangelog`` in a GIT repository and it'll\nprint changelog on its standard output.\n\n\nConfiguration file format\n-------------------------\n\nThe `reference configuration file`_ is quite heavily commented and is quite\nsimple.  You should be able to use it as required.\n\n.. _reference configuration file: https://github.com/vaab/gitchangelog/blob/master/src/gitchangelog/gitchangelog.rc.reference\n\nThe changelog of gitchangelog is generated with himself and with the reference\nconfiguration file. You'll see the output in the `changelog of the PyPI page`_.\n\n.. _changelog of the PyPI page: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/gitchangelog\n\n\nOutput Engines\n--------------\n\nAt the end of the configuration file, you'll notice a variable called\n``output_engine``. By default, it's set to ``rest_py``, which is the\nlegacy python engine to produce the `ReSTructured Text` output format\nthat is shown in above samples. If this engine fits your needs, you\nwon't need to fiddle with this option.\n\nTo render the template, ``gitchangelog`` will generate a data structure that\nwill then be rendered thanks to the output engine. This should help you get\nthe exact output that you need.\n\nAs people might have different needs and knowledge, a templating\nsystem using ``mustache`` is available. ``mustache`` templates are\nprovided to render both `ReSTructured Text` or `markdown` formats. If\nyou know ``mustache`` templating, then you could easily add or modify\nthese existing templates.\n\nA ``mako`` templating engine is also provided. You'll find also a ``mako``\ntemplate producing the same `ReSTructured Text` output than the legacy one.\nIt's provided for reference and/or further tweak if you would rather use `mako`_\ntemplates.\n\n\nMustache\n~~~~~~~~\n\nThe ``mustache``  output engine uses `mustache templates`_.\n\nThe `mustache`_ templates are powered via `pystache`_ the python\nimplementation of the `mustache`_ specifications. So `mustache`_ output engine\nwill only be available if you have `pystache`_ module available in your python\nenvironment.\n\nThere are `mustache templates`_ bundled with the default installation\nof gitchangelog. These can be called by providing a simple label to the\n``mustache(..)`` output_engine, for instance (in your ``.gitchangelog.rc``)::\n\n    output_engine = mustache(\"markdown\")\n\nOr you could provide your own mustache template by specifying an\nabsolute path (or a relative one, starting from the git toplevel of\nyour project by default, or if set, the\n``git config gitchangelog.template-path``\nlocation) to your template file, for instance::\n\n    output_engine = mustache(\".gitchangelog.tpl\")\n\nAnd feel free to copy the bundled templates to use them as bases for\nyour own variations. In the source code, these are located in\n``src/gitchangelog/templates/mustache`` directory, once installed they\nare in ``templates/mustache`` directory starting from where your\n``gitchangelog.py`` was installed.\n\n\n.. _mustache: http://mustache.github.io\n.. _pystache: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pystache\n.. _mustache templates: http://mustache.github.io/mustache.5.html\n\n\nMako\n~~~~\n\nThe ``makotemplate`` output engine templates for ``gitchangelog`` are\npowered via `mako`_ python templating system. So `mako`_ output engine\nwill only be available if you have `mako`_ module available in your\npython environment.\n\nThere are `mako`_ templates bundled with the default installation\nof gitchangelog. These can be called by providing a simple label to the\n``makotemplate(..)`` output_engine, for instance (in your ``.gitchangelog.rc``)::\n\n    output_engine = makotemplate(\"markdown\")\n\nOr you could provide your own mustache template by specifying an\nabsolute path (or a relative one, starting from the git toplevel of\nyour project by default, or if set, the\n``git config gitchangelog.template-path``\nlocation) to your template file, for instance::\n\n    output_engine = makotemplate(\".gitchangelog.tpl\")\n\nAnd feel free to copy the bundled templates to use them as bases for\nyour own variations. In the source code, these are located in\n``src/gitchangelog/templates/mako`` directory, once installed they\nare in ``templates/mako`` directory starting from where your\n``gitchangelog.py`` was installed.\n\n.. _mako: http://www.makotemplates.org\n\n\nChangelog data tree\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis is a sample of the current data structure sent to output engines::\n\n  {'title': 'Changelog',\n   'versions': [{'label': '%%version%% (unreleased)',\n                 'date': None,\n                 'tag': None\n                 'sections': [{'label': 'Changes',\n                               'commits': [{'author': 'John doe',\n                                            'body': '',\n                                            'subject': 'Adding some extra values.'},\n                                           {'author': 'John Doe',\n                                            'body': '',\n                                            'subject': 'Some more changes'}]},\n                              {'label': 'Other',\n                               'commits': [{'author': 'Jim Foo',\n                                            'body': '',\n                                            'subject': 'classic modification'},\n                                           {'author': 'Jane Done',\n                                            'body': '',\n                                            'subject': 'Adding some stuff to do.'}]}]},\n                {'label': 'v0.2.5 (2013-08-06)',\n                 'date': '2013-08-06',\n                 'tag': 'v0.2.5'\n                 'sections': [{'commits': [{'author': 'John Doe',\n                                            'body': '',\n                                            'subject': 'Updating Changelog installation.'}],\n                               'label': 'Changes'}]}]}\n\n\nMerged branches history support\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCommit attribution to a specific version could be tricky. Suppose you have\nthis typical merge tree (spot the tags!)::\n\n    * new: something  (HEAD, tag: 0.2, develop)\n    *   Merge tag '0.1.1' into develop\n    |\\\n    | * fix: out-of-band hotfix  (tag: 0.1.1)\n    * | chg: continued development\n    |/\n    * fix: something  (tag: 0.1)\n    * first commit  (tag: 0.0.1, master)\n\nHere's a minimal draft of gitchangelog to show how commit are\nattributed to versions::\n\n    0.2\n      * new: something.\n      * Merge tag '0.1.1' into develop.\n      * chg: continued development.\n\n    0.1.1\n      * fix: out-of-band hotfix.\n\n    0.1\n      * fix: something.\n\n\n.. note:: you can remove automatically all merge commit from\n  gitchangelog output by using ``include_merge = False`` in the\n  ``.gitchangelog.rc`` file.\n\n\nUse cases\n=========\n\n\nNo sectionning\n--------------\n\nIf you want to remove sectionning but keep anything else, you should\nprobably use::\n\n    section_regexps = [\n        ('', None)\n    ]\n\n    subject_process = (strip | ucfirst | final_dot)\n\nThis will disable sectionning and won't remove the prefixes\nused for sectionning from the commit's summary.\n\n\nIncremental changelog\n---------------------\n\nAlso known as partial changelog generation, this feature allows to\ngenerate only a subpart of your changelog, and combined with\nconfigurable publishing actions, you can insert the result inside\nan existing changelog. Usually this makes sense:\n\n- When wanting to switch to ``gitchangelog``, or change your\n  conventions:\n\n  - part of your history is not following conventions.\n  - you have a previous CHANGELOG you want to blend in.\n\n- You'd rather commit changes to your changelog file for each release:\n\n  - For performance reason, you can then generate changelog only for\n    the new commit and save the result.\n  - Because you want to be able to edit it to make some minor\n    edition if needed.\n\n\nGenerating partial changelog is as simple as ``gitchangelog\nREVLIST``. Examples follows::\n\n    ## will output only tags between 0.0.2 (excluded) and 0.0.3 (included)\n    gitchangelog 0.0.2..0.0.3\n\n    ## will output only tags since 0.0.3 (excluded)\n    gitchangelog ^0.0.3 HEAD\n\n    ## will output all tags up to 0.0.3 (included)\n    gitchangelog 0.0.3\n\n\nAdditionally, ``gitchangelog`` can figure out automatically which\nrevision is the last for you (with some little help). This is done by\nspecifying the ``revs`` config option. This config file option will be\nused as if specified on the command line.\n\nHere is an example that fits the current changelog format::\n\n    revs = [\n        Caret(\n            FileFirstRegexMatch(\n    \t        \"CHANGELOG.rst\",\n    \t        r\"(?P<rev>[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+))\\s+\\([0-9]+-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\\)\\n--+\\n\")),\n    ]\n\nThis will look into the file ``CHANGELOG.rst`` for the first match of\nthe given regex and return the match of the ``rev`` regex sub-pattern\nit as a string. The ``Caret`` function will simply prefix the given\nstring with a ``^``. As a consequence, this code will prevent\nrecreating any previously generated changelog section (more information\nabout the `REVLIST syntax`_ from ``git rev-list`` arguments.)\n\n.. _REVLIST syntax: https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rev-list#_description\n\nNote that the data structure provided to the template will set the\n``title`` to ``None`` if you provided no REVLIST through command-line\nor the config file (or if the revlist was equivalently set to\n``[\"HEAD\", ]``).  This a good way to make your template detect it is\nin \"incremental mode\".\n\nBy default, this will only output to standard output the new sections\nof your changelog, you might want to insert it directly in your existing\nchangelog. This is where ``publish`` parameters will help you. By default\nit is set to ``stdout``, and you might want to set it to::\n\n    publish = FileInsertIntoFirstRegexMatch(\n        \"CHANGELOG.rst\",\n        r'/(?P<rev>[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+)?)\\s+\\([0-9]+-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\\)\\n--+\\n/',\n        idx=lambda m: m.start(1)\n    )\n\nThe full recipe could be::\n\n    OUTPUT_FILE = \"CHANGELOG.rst\"\n    INSERT_POINT = r\"\\b(?P<rev>[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+)\\s+\\([0-9]+-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\\)\\n--+\\n\"\n    revs = [\n            Caret(FileFirstRegexMatch(OUTPUT_FILE, INSERT_POINT)),\n            \"HEAD\"\n    ]\n\n    action = FileInsertAtFirstRegexMatch(\n        OUTPUT_FILE, INSERT_POINT,\n        idx=lambda m: m.start(1)\n    )\n\n\nAlternatively, you can use this other recipe, using ``FileRegexSubst``, that has\nthe added advantage of being able to update the unreleased part if you had it already\ngenerated and need a re-fresh because you added new commits or amended some commits::\n\n    OUTPUT_FILE = \"CHANGELOG.rst\"\n    INSERT_POINT_REGEX = r'''(?isxu)\n    ^\n    (\n      \\s*Changelog\\s*(\\n|\\r\\n|\\r)        ## ``Changelog`` line\n      ==+\\s*(\\n|\\r\\n|\\r){2}              ## ``=========`` rest underline\n    )\n\n    (                     ## Match all between changelog and release rev\n        (\n          (?!\n             (?<=(\\n|\\r))                ## look back for newline\n             %(rev)s                     ## revision\n             \\s+\n             \\([0-9]+-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\\)(\\n|\\r\\n|\\r)   ## date\n               --+(\\n|\\r\\n|\\r)                          ## ``---`` underline\n          )\n          .\n        )*\n    )\n\n    (?P<rev>%(rev)s)\n    ''' % {'rev': r\"[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+)?\"}\n\n    revs = [\n        Caret(FileFirstRegexMatch(OUTPUT_FILE, INSERT_POINT_REGEX)),\n        \"HEAD\"\n    ]\n\n    publish = FileRegexSubst(OUTPUT_FILE, INSERT_POINT_REGEX, r\"\\1\\o\\g<rev>\")\n\n\nAs a second example, here is the same recipe for mustache markdown format::\n\n    OUTPUT_FILE = \"CHANGELOG.rst\"\n    INSERT_POINT_REGEX = r'''(?isxu)\n    ^\n    (\n      \\s*\\#\\s+Changelog\\s*(\\n|\\r\\n|\\r)        ## ``Changelog`` line\n    )\n\n    (                     ## Match all between changelog and release rev\n        (\n          (?!\n             (?<=(\\n|\\r))                ## look back for newline\n             \\#\\#\\s+%(rev)s                     ## revision\n             \\s+\n             \\([0-9]+-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}\\)(\\n|\\r\\n|\\r)   ## date\n          )\n          .\n        )*\n    )\n\n    (?P<tail>\\#\\#\\s+(?P<rev>%(rev)s))\n    ''' % {'rev': r\"[0-9]+\\.[0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+)?\"}\n\n    revs = [\n        Caret(FileFirstRegexMatch(OUTPUT_FILE, INSERT_POINT_REGEX)),\n        \"HEAD\"\n    ]\n\n    publish = FileRegexSubst(OUTPUT_FILE, INSERT_POINT_REGEX, r\"\\1\\o\\n\\g<tail>\")\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nAny suggestion or issue is welcome. Push request are very welcome,\nplease check out the guidelines.\n\n\nPush Request Guidelines\n-----------------------\n\nYou can send any code. I'll look at it and will integrate it myself in\nthe code base while leaving you as the commit(s) author. This process\ncan take time and it'll take less time if you follow the following\nguidelines:\n\n- check your code with PEP8 or pylint. Try to stick to 80 columns wide.\n- separate your commits per smallest concern\n- each functionality/bugfix commit should contain the code, tests,\n  and doc.\n- each commit should pass the tests (to allow easy bisect)\n- prior minor commit with typographic or code cosmetic changes are\n  very welcome.

(fixes #81) [Valentin Lab]\n\n  In 2.5.1, ``gitchangelog show ^3.0.0`` command would implicitly add a\n  ``HEAD`` in the revlist specifiers, effectively being equivalent to\n  ``0.0.3..HEAD``.\n\n  This behavior is removed in 3.0.0+ to stick to ``git rev-list REVLIST``\n  syntax.  As a consequence, ``gitchangelog ^3.0.0`` won't select any\n  revision and thus will cast an error about no commits matching revlist.\n\n\n3.0.2 (2017-04-21)\n------------------\n\nFix\n~~~\n- [mustache/markdown] template is now compatible with incremental\n  changelog generation patterns. (fixes #80) [Valentin Lab]\n\n\n3.0.1 (2017-03-17)\n------------------\n\nFix\n~~~\n- Support of commits with empty message. (fixes #76) [Valentin Lab]\n\n\n3.0.0 (2017-03-17)\n------------------\n\nNew\n~~~\n- Template path can now be specified in ``git config``. (fixes #73)\n  [Valentin Lab]\n- Added ``FileRegexSubst`` to allow updatable incremental recipe.\n  [Valentin Lab]\n\n  With the added function and recipe as an example, you can update a\n  current unreleased changelog additionaly to the traditional incremental\n  behavior. ``FileRegexSubst`` might prove itself to be more powerfull\n  tahn ``FileInsertAtFirstRegexMatch`` if you handle fairly complex regexes.\n- Configurable ``publish`` action to allow more automated changelog\n  scenarios (fixes #39) [Valentin Lab]\n\n  In particular, projects using incremental changelog generation can now\n  fully automate the process by using a ``publish`` action that inserts\n  new sections in an existing changelog file.\n- ``unreleased_version_label`` can now be computed on the fly. [Valentin\n  Lab]\n\n  This can let you rename the first section about non yet tagged commit\n  more precisely. For instance by using the commit hash or any git\n  property.\n- Full tested windows support added. [Valentin Lab]\n- Reference config file is not anymore required. (fixes #54) [Valentin\n  Lab]\n- New ``revs`` config file option allowing dynamically setting target\n  rev-list. (fixes #61) [Valentin Lab]\n\n  With this option, incremental changelog become more streamlined. With\n  prior behavior, you had to know which was the last version prior to\n  calling ``gitchangelog``. Now, calling ``gitchangelog`` alone can generate\n  the exact last missing part thanks to this new config option.\n- Templates now support direct path to files (fixes #46, fixes #63).\n  [Héctor Pablos, Valentin Lab]\n\n  Note that relative paths will be searched from the git toplevel.\n- Provide helpers to integrate ``Co-Authored-By`` trailer value. (fixes\n  #69) [Valentin Lab]\n\n  You can use now ``commit[\"authors\"]`` in templates to get a list of all\n  authors of a commit. See the mako template ``restructuredtext.tpl`` for\n  example of usage. Mustache templates gets also their own baked in joined\n  list of authors through ``commit[\"author_names_joined\"]``.\n- Provide complete access on commit API to templates (fixes #18)\n  [Valentin Lab]\n- Supports trailer key values support. [Valentin Lab]\n- Windows compatibility. [Jean-Baptiste Lab, Laurent LAPORTE, Michele,\n  Valentin Lab]\n\nChanges\n~~~~~~~\n- Use tagger date when tags are annotated instead of commit date. (fixes\n  #60) [Valentin Lab]\n- Removed the need of the ``show`` positional argument. [Valentin Lab]\n- Suppression of the obsolete ``gitchangelog init`` command. [Valentin\n  Lab]\n\nFix\n~~~\n- Support closed or closing pipes on gitchangelog's stdout gracefully.\n  [Valentin Lab]\n\n  Python would output some angry comments for instance when using::\n\n       gitchangelog | head\n\n  Now it is much more graceful and will let the process finish earlier\n  without complaining.\n- Revlist would not work as expected on windows. [Valentin Lab]\n\n  Windows does not support single quotes in command line as linux\n  does. Fortunately there is no requirements on singles quotes so they\n  were removed everywhere, ensuring a better windows compatibility.\n- Using revlists could display unwanted commits or no commits. [Valentin\n  Lab]\n\n  This was happening when specifying revisions that didn't match\n  commits tagged by tags matching the ``tag_filter_regexp``.\n- Ability to specify rev-lists for partial changelogs creation was not\n  working on windows. [Valentin Lab]\n- Encoding issues prevented log to be outputed on specific windows\n  versions. [Valentin Lab]\n- Fixed encoding issue when reading UTF-8 git logs with a different\n  default locale. [Valentin Lab]\n\n  Windows platform were more likely to get hit by this bug as their\n  default code page is not ``utf-8``. It was fixed by using an explicit\n  encoding when reading git logs. The default value for this encoding\n  can now be set in the ``gitchangelog``'s config file, per-repository.\n  Although, this option should be only set in pathological configuration\n  as the default behavior is to use ``git config i18n.logOutputEncoding``\n  when set, or if not set, ``utf-8``, which is the default log encoding\n  of git.\n\n\n2.5.1 (2015-11-11)\n------------------\n\nFix\n~~~\n- Reference config is used for defaults. [Tuukka Mustonen]\n- Error message when called in non-git directories was not correctly\n  displayed on python 3. [Valentin Lab]\n- ``--debug`` argument would generate command line arguments parsing\n  errors on python 2.7.  (fixes #66) [Valentin Lab]\n\n\n2.5.0 (2016-10-16)\n------------------\n\nNew\n~~~\n- Hide unexpected traceback per default and allow them to be displayed\n  if wanted. [Valentin Lab]\n- New lines fixes in current default ReST format (fixes #62) [Stavros\n  Korokithakis]\n\n  These were modified:\n\n  - no new line between list element, except when there's some\n    body message to display, then use only one new line at the\n    beginning of the body to issues with possible lists in body.\n  - one new line before section titles.\n  - two new lines before versions titles.\n\nFix\n~~~\n- Output warning on stderr in some weird cases (fixes #52) [Valentin\n  Lab]\n\n  If no tag are found in the repository, or no tag matches the filter\n  regex, or if all commits are ignored... this will lead to disturbing but\n  legit outputs from ``gitchangelog``. So as to help diagnose what is\n  going on, additional warnings are then printed when edge cases are\n  encountered.\n- [mustache/restructuredtext] avoid HTML-escaping content of variables\n  (fixes #64) [Mark Milstein]\n\n\n2.4.0 (2015-11-10)\n------------------\n\nNew\n~~~\n- Add optional positional argument ``REVLIST`` to allow incremental\n  changelog output (fixes #26) [Valentin Lab]\n\n  See use cases documentations for more information.\n\n\n2.3.0 (2015-09-25)\n------------------\n\nFix\n~~~\n- Nasty hidden bug that would break python3 (fixes #27) [Valentin Lab]\n\n  Actually this bug was revealed by python3 random hashes (thanks to\n  @rschoon for the hint) and could be reproduced on python2.7 with ``-R``\n  mode.\n\n  The ``git show`` command actually will behave differently if given a tag\n  reference and print random unexpected information before using the\n  format string. This would prefix a lot of mess to the first field being\n  asked in the format string.\n\n  And this first field is dependent on the internal order of a dict, and\n  this order is not important as such, and so nothing was done on this\n  part.\n\n  On python2.7, somehow, it would always be the same order that revealed\n  to have no consequence (probably one of the rare field not used in\n  current changelogs).\n\n  Python3 or Python2.7 -R would shuffle this order and then trigger the\n  error whenever this prefix would be appended to actually important\n  fields that went into some further processing (as casted to int for\n  the timestamp for instance).\n\n\n2.2.1 (2015-06-09)\n------------------\n\nFix\n~~~\n- Fix: doc: ``ìnclude_merge`` options was wrongly typed in sample config\n  files (reported by @tuukkamustonen, fixed #29). [Valentin Lab]\n- Updated doc to reflec that there are no support of windows for now.\n  (fixes #28) [Valentin Lab]\n\n  Actually windows will fail on ``subprocess`` call. (see #28)\n- Remove commit's meta-information footer from changelog output. (fixes\n  #25) [Valentin Lab]\n\n  Some various tools (thinking of Gerrit) might leave some\n  meta-information in the footer of your commit message's body that you do\n  not want to be repeated in your changelog. So all values in the footer\n  are removed (This concerns ``Change-Id``, ``Acked-by``, ``CC``,\n  ``Signed-off-by``, ``Bug`` ... and any other value).\n\n\n2.2.0 (2015-01-27)\n------------------\n\nNew\n~~~\n- Provide support for older config file format. [Valentin Lab]\n- Added 'octobercms-plugin' mako template. (fixes #16) [Valentin Lab]\n- Added ``body_process`` and ``subject_process`` options. (fixes #22)\n  [Valentin Lab]\n\n  These options superseeds ``replace_regexps`` and ``body_split_regexp``\n  as they provide a full control over text transformation of the subject\n  or the body of the commit before they get included in the changelog.\n- Added ``include_merge`` option to filter out merge commit. [Casey\n  Duquette]\n\nChanges\n~~~~~~~\n- Produce a more linear commit history (fixes #14) [Casey Duquette]\n\n  Instead of retrieving the git log ordered by date, retrieve the log as\n  a difference between tags to produce a more accurate view of changes\n  between releases.\n\n  For instance, imagine this git graph::\n\n    * 6c0fd62 (HEAD, tag: sprint-6, origin/smoke, smoke, develop)\n    *   5292a28 Merge back to develop\n    |\\\n    | * 6612fce (tag: sprint-5.1, origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) super important hotfix\n    * | 7d6286f more development work\n    * | 8c1e3d6 continued development work\n    * | fa3d4bd development work\n    |/\n    * ec1a19c (tag: sprint-5)\n\n  Previously, commits ``fa3d4bd``, ``8c1e3d6``, ``7d6286f`` that\n  occurred on the develop branch before the hotfix that led to tagging\n  ``sprint-5.1``, were captured in the changelog under release\n  ``sprint-5.1`` because of the order of the commits. But it is obvious\n  that these commits were not included in a release until\n  ``sprint-6``. The new method of calculating the changelog will capture\n  this and reflect it properly, assigning those changes to ``sprint-6``.\n\nFix\n~~~\n- Last commit was omitted (fixes #23). [Valentin Lab]\n- Bogus messages when template didn't exist. [Valentin Lab]\n\n  Refactored out the common code and corrected the bad error message.\n- Removed hypothetical memory exhaust while parsing ``git log``.\n  [Valentin Lab]\n\n  Parse stdout as it's produced by git log by chunks.\n\n\n2.1.2 (2014-04-25)\n------------------\n\nFix\n~~~\n- Fail with error message when config path exists but is not a file.\n  (fixes #11) [Casey Duquette]\n\n  For example, the config file could be a directory.\n\n\n2.1.1 (2014-04-15)\n------------------\n\nFix\n~~~\n- Removed exception if you had file which name that matched a tag's\n  name. (fixes #9) [Valentin Lab]\n\n\n2.1.0 (2014-03-25)\n------------------\n\nNew\n~~~\n- Python3 compatibility. [Valentin Lab]\n- Much greater performance on big repository by issuing only one shell\n  command for all the commits. (fixes #7) [Valentin Lab]\n- Add ``init`` argument to create a full ``.gitchangelog.rc`` in current\n  git repository. [Valentin Lab]\n- Remove optional first argument that could specify the target git\n  repository to consider. [Valentin Lab]\n\n  This is to remove duplicate way to do things. ``gitchangelog`` should be run\n  from within a git repository.\n\n  Any usage of ``gitchangelog MYREPO`` can be written ``(cd MYREPO;\n  gitchangelog)``.\n- Use a standard formatting configuration by default. [Valentin Lab]\n\n  A default `standard` way of formatting is used if you don't provide\n  any configuration file. Additionaly, any option you define in your\n  configuration file will be added \"on-top\" of the default configuration\n  values. This can reduce config file size or even remove the need of\n  one if you follow the standard.\n\n  And, thus, you can tweak the standard for your needs by providing only partial\n  configuration file. See tests for examples.\n- Remove user or system wide configuration file lookup. [Valentin Lab]\n\n  This follows reflexion that you build a changelog for a repository and\n  that the rules to make the changelog should definitively be explicit and\n  thus belongs to the repository itself.\n\n  Not a justification, but removing user and system wide configuration files\n  also greatly simplifies testability.\n\nFix\n~~~\n- Encoding issues with non-ascii chars. [Valentin Lab]\n- Avoid using pipes for windows compatibility and be more performant by\n  avoiding to unroll full log to get the last commit. [Valentin Lab]\n- Better support of exotic features of git config file format. (fixes\n  #4) [Valentin Lab]\n\n  git config file format allows ambiguous keys:\n\n      [a \"b.c\"]\n          d = foo\n      [a.b \"c\"]\n          e = foo\n      [a.b.c]\n          f = foo\n\n  Are all valid. So code was simplified to use directly ``git config``.\n  This simplification will deal also with cases where section could be\n  attributed values:\n\n      [a \"b\"]\n          c = foo\n      [a]\n          b = foo\n\n  By avoiding to parse the entire content of the file, and relying on\n  ``git config`` implementation we ensure to remain compatible and not\n  re-implement the parsing of this file format.\n- Gitchangelog shouldn't fail if it fails to parse your git config.\n  [Michael Hahn]\n\n\n2.0.0 (2013-08-20)\n------------------\n\nNew\n~~~\n- Added a ``mako`` output engine with standard ReSTructured text format\n  for reference. [Valentin Lab]\n- Added some information on path lookup scheme to find\n  ``gitchangelog.rc`` configuration file. [Valentin Lab]\n- Added templating system and examples with ``mustache`` template\n  support for restructured text and markdown output format. [David\n  Loureiro]\n\nChanges\n~~~~~~~\n- Removed ``pkg`` and ``dev`` commits from default sample changelog\n  output. [Valentin Lab]\n\nFix\n~~~\n- Some error message weren't written on stderr. [Valentin Lab]\n\n\n1.1.0 (2012-05-03)\n------------------\n\nNew\n~~~\n- New config file lookup scheme which adds a new possible default\n  location ``.gitchangelog.rc`` in the root of the git repository.\n  [Valentin Lab]\n- Added a new section to get a direct visual of ``gitchangelog`` output.\n  Reworded some sentences and did some other minor additions. [Valentin\n  Lab]\n\nChanges\n~~~~~~~\n- Removed old ``gitchangelog.rc.sample`` in favor of the new documented\n  one. [Valentin Lab]\n\nFix\n~~~\n- The sample file was not coherent with the doc, and is now accepting\n  'test' and 'doc' audience. [Valentin Lab]\n\n\n1.0.2 (2012-05-02)\n------------------\n\nNew\n~~~\n- Added a new sample file heavily documented. [Valentin Lab]\n\nFix\n~~~\n- ``ignore_regexps`` where bogus and would match only from the beginning\n  of the line. [Valentin Lab]\n- Display author date rather than commit date. [Valentin Lab]\n\n\n0.1.2 (2011-06-29)\n------------------\n\nNew\n~~~\n- Added ``body_split_regexp`` option to attempts to format correctly\n  body of commit. [Valentin Lab]\n- Use a list of tuple instead of a dict for ``section_regexps`` to be\n  able to manage order between section on find match. [Valentin Lab]\n\nFix\n~~~\n- ``git`` in later versions seems to fail on ``git config <key>`` with\n  errlvl 255, that was not supported. [Valentin Lab]\n- Removed Traceback when there were no tags at all in the current git\n  repository. [Valentin Lab]\n\n\n0.1.1 (2011-06-29)\n------------------\n\nNew\n~~~\n- Added section classifiers (ie: New, Change, Bugs) and updated the\n  sample rc file. [Valentin Lab]\n- Added a succint ``--help`` support.
