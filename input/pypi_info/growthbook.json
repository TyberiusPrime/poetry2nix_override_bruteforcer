You can either use the built-in fetching/caching logic or implement your own custom solution.\n\n### Built-in Fetching and Caching\n\nTo use the built-in fetching and caching logic, in the `GrowthBook` constructor, pass in your GrowthBook `api_host` and `client_key`. If you have encryption enabled for your GrowthBook endpoint, you also need to pass the `decryption_key` into the constructor.\n\nThen, call the `load_features()` method to initiate the HTTP request with a cache layer.\n\nHere's a full example:\n\n```python\ngb = GrowthBook(\n  api_host = \"https://cdn.growthbook.io\",\n  client_key = \"sdk-abc123\",\n  # How long to cache features in seconds (Optional, default 60s)\n  cache_ttl = 60,\n)\ngb.load_features()\n```\n\n#### Caching\n\nGrowthBook comes with a custom in-memory cache. If you run Python in a multi-process mode, the different processes cannot share memory, so you likely want to switch to a distributed cache system like Redis instead.\n\nHere is an example of using Redis:\n\n```python\nfrom redis import Redis\nimport json\nfrom growthbook import GrowthBook, AbstractFeatureCache, feature_repo\n\nclass RedisFeatureCache(AbstractFeatureCache):\n  def __init__(self):\n    self.r = Redis(host='localhost', port=6379)\n    self.prefix = \"gb:\"\n\n  def get(self, key: str):\n    data = self.r.get(self.prefix + key)\n    # Data stored as a JSON string, parse into dict before returning\n    return None if data is None else json.loads(data)\n\n  def set(self, key: str, value: dict, ttl: int) -> None:\n    self.r.set(self.prefix + key, json.dumps(value))\n    self.r.expire(self.prefix + key, ttl)\n\n# Configure GrowthBook to use your custom cache class\nfeature_repo.set_cache(RedisFeatureCache())\n```\n\n### Custom Implementation\n\nIf you prefer to handle the entire fetching/caching logic yourself, you can just pass in a `dict` of features from the GrowthBook API directly into the constructor:\n\n```python\n# From the GrowthBook API\nfeatures = {'my-feature':{'defaultValue':False}}\n\ngb = GrowthBook(\n  features = features\n)\n```\n\nNote: When doing this, you do not need to specify your `api_host` or `client_key` and you don't need to call `gb.load_features()`.\n\n## GrowthBook class\n\nThe GrowthBook constructor has the following parameters:\n\n- **enabled** (`bool`) - Flag to globally disable all experiments. Default true.\n- **attributes** (`dict`) - Dictionary of user attributes that are used for targeting and to assign variations\n- **url** (`str`) - The URL of the current request (if applicable)\n- **qa_mode** (`boolean`) - If true, random assignment is disabled and only explicitly forced variations are used.\n- **on_experiment_viewed** (`callable`) - A function that takes `experiment` and `result` as arguments.\n- **api_host** (`str`) - The GrowthBook API host to fetch feature flags from. Defaults to `https://cdn.growthbook.io`\n- **client_key** (`str`) - The client key that will be passed to the API Host to fetch feature flags\n- **decryption_key** (`str`) - If the GrowthBook API endpoint has encryption enabled, specify the decryption key here\n- **cache_ttl** (`int`) - How long to cache features in-memory from the GrowthBook API (seconds, default `60`)\n- **features** (`dict`) - Feature definitions from the GrowthBook API (only required if `client_key` is not specified)\n- **forced_variations** (`dict`) - Dictionary of forced experiment variations (used for QA)\n\nThere are also getter and setter methods for features and attributes if you need to update them later in the request:\n\n```python\ngb.set_features(gb.get_features())\ngb.set_attributes(gb.get_attributes())\n```\n\n### Attributes\n\nYou can specify attributes about the current user and request. These are used for two things:\n\n1.  Feature targeting (e.g. paid users get one value, free users get another)\n2.  Assigning persistent variations in A/B tests (e.g. user id \"123\" always gets variation B)\n\nAttributes can be any JSON data type - boolean, integer, float, string, list, or dict.\n\n```python\nattributes = {\n  'id': \"123\",\n  'loggedIn': True,\n  'age': 21.5,\n  'tags': [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"],\n  'account': {\n    'age': 90\n  }\n}\n\n# Pass into constructor\ngb = GrowthBook(attributes = attributes)\n\n# Or set later\ngb.set_attributes(attributes)\n```\n\n### Tracking Experiments\n\nAny time an experiment is run to determine the value of a feature, you want to track that event in your analytics system.\n\nYou can use the `on_experiment_viewed` option to do this:\n\n```python\nfrom growthbook import GrowthBook, Experiment, Result\n\ndef on_experiment_viewed(experiment: Experiment, result: Result):\n  # Use whatever event tracking system you want\n  analytics.track(attributes[\"id\"], \"Experiment Viewed\", {\n    'experimentId': experiment.key,\n    'variationId': result.variationId\n  })\n\n# Pass into constructor\ngb = GrowthBook(\n  on_experiment_viewed = on_experiment_viewed\n)\n```\n\n## Using Features\n\nThere are 3 main methods for interacting with features.\n\n- `gb.is_on(\"feature-key\")` returns true if the feature is on\n- `gb.is_off(\"feature-key\")` returns false if the feature is on\n- `gb.get_feature_value(\"feature-key\", \"default\")` returns the value of the feature with a fallback\n\nIn addition, you can use `gb.evalFeature(\"feature-key\")` to get back a `FeatureResult` object with the following properties:\n\n- **value** - The JSON-decoded value of the feature (or `None` if not defined)\n- **on** and **off** - The JSON-decoded value cast to booleans\n- **source** - Why the value was assigned to the user. One of `unknownFeature`, `defaultValue`, `force`, or `experiment`\n- **experiment** - Information about the experiment (if any) which was used to assign the value to the user\n- **experimentResult** - The result of the experiment (if any) which was used to assign the value to the user\n\n## Sticky Bucketing\n\nBy default GrowthBook does not persist assigned experiment variations for a user. We rely on deterministic hashing to ensure that the same user attributes always map to the same experiment variation. However, there are cases where this isn't good enough. For example, if you change targeting conditions in the middle of an experiment, users may stop being shown a variation even if they were previously bucketed into it.\n\nSticky Bucketing is a solution to these issues. You can provide a Sticky Bucket Service to the GrowthBook instance to persist previously seen variations and ensure that the user experience remains consistent for your users.\n\nA sample `InMemoryStickyBucketService` implementation is provided for reference, but in production you will definitely want to implement your own version using a database, cookies, or similar for persistence.\n\nSticky Bucket documents contain three fields\n\n- `attributeName` - The name of the attribute used to identify the user (e.g. `id`, `cookie_id`, etc.)\n- `attributeValue` - The value of the attribute (e.g. `123`)\n- `assignments` - A dictionary of persisted experiment assignments. For example: `{\"exp1__0\":\"control\"}`\n\nThe attributeName/attributeValue combo is the primary key.\n\nHere's an example implementation using a theoretical `db` object:\n\n```python\nfrom growthbook import AbstractStickyBucketService, GrowthBook\n\nclass MyStickyBucketService(AbstractStickyBucketService):\n    # Lookup a sticky bucket document\n    def get_assignments(self, attributeName: str, attributeValue: str) -> Optional[Dict]:\n        return db.find({\n          \"attributeName\": attributeName,\n          \"attributeValue\": attributeValue\n        })\n\n    def save_assignments(self, doc: Dict) -> None:\n        # Insert new record if not exists, otherwise update\n        db.upsert({\n            \"attributeName\": doc[\"attributeName\"],\n            \"attributeValue\": doc[\"attributeValue\"]\n        }, {\n          \"$set\": {\n            \"assignments\": doc[\"assignments\"]\n          }\n        })\n\n# Pass in an instance of this service to your GrowthBook constructor\n\ngb = GrowthBook(\n  sticky_bucket_service = MyStickyBucketService()\n)\n```\n\n## Inline Experiments\n\nInstead of declaring all features up-front and referencing them by ids in your code, you can also just run an experiment directly. This is done with the `run` method:\n\n```python\nfrom growthbook import Experiment\n\nexp = Experiment(\n  key = \"my-experiment\",\n  variations = [\"red\", \"blue\", \"green\"]\n)\n\n# Either \"red\", \"blue\", or \"green\"\nprint(gb.run(exp).value)\n```\n\nAs you can see, there are 2 required parameters for experiments, a string key, and an array of variations. Variations can be any data type, not just strings.\n\nThere are a number of additional settings to control the experiment behavior:\n\n- **key** (`str`) - The globally unique tracking key for the experiment\n- **variations** (`any[]`) - The different variations to choose between\n- **seed** (`str`) - Added to the user id when hashing to determine a variation. Defaults to the experiment `key`\n- **weights** (`float[]`) - How to weight traffic between variations. Must add to 1.\n- **coverage** (`float`) - What percent of users should be included in the experiment (between 0 and 1, inclusive)\n- **condition** (`dict`) - Targeting conditions\n- **force** (`int`) - All users included in the experiment will be forced into the specified variation index\n- **hashAttribute** (`string`) - What user attribute should be used to assign variations (defaults to \"id\")\n- **hashVersion** (`int`) - What version of our hashing algorithm to use. We recommend using the latest version `2`.\n- **namespace** (`tuple[str,float,float]`) - Used to run mutually exclusive experiments.\n\nHere's an example that uses all of them:\n\n```python\nexp = Experiment(\n  key=\"my-test\",\n  # Variations can be a list of any data type\n  variations=[0, 1],\n  # If this changes, it will re-randomize all users in the experiment\n  seed=\"abcdef123456\",\n  # Run a 40/60 experiment instead of the default even split (50/50)\n  weights=[0.4, 0.6],\n  # Only include 20% of users in the experiment\n  coverage=0.2,\n  # Targeting condition using a MongoDB-like syntax\n  condition={\n    'country': 'US',\n    'browser': {\n      '$in': ['chrome', 'firefox']\n    }\n  },\n  # Use an alternate attribute for assigning variations (default is 'id')\n  hashAttribute=\"sessionId\",\n  # Use the latest hashing algorithm\n  hashVersion=2,\n  # Includes the first 50% of users in the \"pricing\" namespace\n  # Another experiment with a non-overlapping range will be mutually exclusive (e.g. [0.5, 1])\n  namespace=(\"pricing\", 0, 0.5),\n)\n```\n\n### Inline Experiment Return Value\n\nA call to `run` returns a `Result` object with a few useful properties:\n\n```python\nresult = gb.run(exp)\n\n# If user is part of the experiment\nprint(result.inExperiment) # True or False\n\n# The index of the assigned variation\nprint(result.variationId) # e.g. 0 or 1\n\n# The value of the assigned variation\nprint(result.value) # e.g. \"A\" or \"B\"\n\n# If the variation was randomly assigned by hashing user attributes\nprint(result.hashUsed) # True or False\n\n# The user attribute used to assign a variation\nprint(result.hashAttribute) # \"id\"\n\n# The value of that attribute\nprint(result.hashValue) # e.g. \"123\"\n```\n\nThe `inExperiment` flag will be false if the user was excluded from being part of the experiment for any reason (e.g. failed targeting conditions).\n\nThe `hashUsed` flag will only be true if the user was randomly assigned a variation. If the user was forced into a specific variation instead, this flag will be false.\n\n### Example Experiments\n\n3-way experiment with uneven variation weights:\n\n```python\ngb.run(Experiment(\n  key = \"3-way-uneven\",\n  variations = [\"A\",\"B\",\"C\"],\n  weights = [0.5, 0.25, 0.25]\n))\n```\n\nSlow rollout (10% of users who match the targeting condition):\n\n```python\n# User is marked as being in \"qa\" and \"beta\"\ngb = GrowthBook(\n  attributes = {\n    \"id\": \"123\",\n    \"beta\": True,\n    \"qa\": True,\n  },\n)\n\ngb.run(Experiment(\n  key = \"slow-rollout\",\n  variations = [\"A\", \"B\"],\n  coverage = 0.1,\n  condition = {\n    'beta': True\n  }\n))\n```\n\nComplex variations\n\n```python\nresult = gb.run(Experiment(\n  key = \"complex-variations\",\n  variations = [\n    (\"blue\", \"large\"),\n    (\"green\", \"small\")\n  ],\n))\n\n# Either \"blue,large\" OR \"green,small\"\nprint(result.value[0] + \",\" + result.value[1])\n```\n\nAssign variations based on something other than user id\n\n```python\ngb = GrowthBook(\n  attributes = {\n    \"id\": \"123\",\n    \"company\": \"growthbook\"\n  }\n)\n\n# Users in the same company will always get the same variation\ngb.run(Experiment(\n  key = \"by-company-id\",\n  variations = [\"A\", \"B\"],\n  hashAttribute = \"company\"\n))\n```\n\n## Logging\n\nThe GrowthBook SDK uses a Python logger with the name `growthbook` and includes helpful info for debugging as well as warnings/errors if something is misconfigured.\n\nHere's an example of logging to the console\n\n```python\nimport logging\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger('growthbook')\nlogger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)\n\nhandler = logging.StreamHandler()\nformatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s %(name)s %(levelname)s %(message)s')\nhandler.setFormatter(formatter)\nlogger.addHandler(handler)\n```\n\n\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":null,"downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-python","keywords":"growthbook","license":"MIT","maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"name":"growthbook","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/growthbook/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/growthbook/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook-python"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/growthbook/1.1.0/","requires_dist":["cryptography","typing-extensions","urllib3"],"requires_python":">=3.6","summary":"Powerful
