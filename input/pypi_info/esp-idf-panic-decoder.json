These hooks help to identify simple issues before committing code for review.\n\nTo use the tool, first install ``pre-commit``. Then enable the ``pre-commit`` and ``commit-msg`` git hooks:\n\n```sh\npython -m pip install pre-commit\npre-commit install -t pre-commit -t commit-msg\n```\n\nOn the first commit ``pre-commit`` will install the hooks, subsequent checks will be significantly faster. If an error is found an appropriate error message will be displayed.\n\n\n#### Conventional Commits\n\n``esp-idf-panic-decoder`` complies with the [Conventional Commits standard](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#specification). Every commit message is checked with [Conventional Precommit Linter](https://github.com/espressif/conventional-precommit-linter), ensuring it adheres to the standard.\n\n\n## License\n\nThis document and the attached source code are released as Free Software under Apache License Version 2.
