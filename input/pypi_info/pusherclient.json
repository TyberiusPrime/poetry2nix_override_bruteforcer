You can get it here: <http://github.com/newbamboo/pusher_client_python>\n\n    import pusher\n    pusher.app_id = app_id\n    pusher.key = appkey\n\n    p = pusher.Pusher()\n    p['mychannel'].trigger('myevent', 'mydata')\n\nThanks\n------\n\nBuilt using the websocket-client module from <http://github.com/liris/websocket-client>.\nThe ruby gem by Logan Koester which provides a similar service was also very helpful for a reference.  Take a look at it here: <http://github.com/logankoester/pusher-client>.\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nMTI License - See LICENSE for details.","description_content_type":null,"docs_url":null,"download_url":"UNKNOWN","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/ekulyk/PythonPusherClient","keywords":"pusher websocket client","license":"MIT","maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"name":"pusherclient","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/pusherclient/","platform":"UNKNOWN","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/pusherclient/","project_urls":{"Download":"UNKNOWN","Homepage":"https://github.com/ekulyk/PythonPusherClient"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/pusherclient/0.3.0/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":null,"summary":"Pusher websocket client for python","version":"0.3.0","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":1342584,"releases":{"0.3.0":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"02e10b7e6d15d0b4b905f0d8db152e4cb3f900f509b63fdac6a898f3df8e139c","md5":"516219a01d3d51a7f37991a6135930b3","sha256":"6a23f2c9255c31301d21728743fc3661e078faed8a6e4206e8774739917de33c"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"pusherclient-0.3.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"516219a01d3d51a7f37991a6135930b3","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":6320,"upload_time":"2014-12-13T20:29:28","upload_time_iso_8601":"2014-12-13T20:29:28.318457Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/02/e1/0b7e6d15d0b4b905f0d8db152e4cb3f900f509b63fdac6a898f3df8e139c/pusherclient-0.3.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"02e10b7e6d15d0b4b905f0d8db152e4cb3f900f509b63fdac6a898f3df8e139c","md5":"516219a01d3d51a7f37991a6135930b3","sha256":"6a23f2c9255c31301d21728743fc3661e078faed8a6e4206e8774739917de33c"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"pusherclient-0.3.0.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"516219a01d3d51a7f37991a6135930b3","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":6320,"upload_time":"2014-12-13T20:29:28","upload_time_iso_8601":"2014-12-13T20:29:28.318457Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/02/e1/0b7e6d15d0b4b905f0d8db152e4cb3f900f509b63fdac6a898f3df8e139c/pusherclient-0.3.0.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
