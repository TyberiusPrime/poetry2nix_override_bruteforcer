It only works under Python 3.\n\nIt is intended to be used when you are running a long analysis in the background and want to know when it is ready.\n\nExample Use\n=============\n\n::\n\n   import beepy\n   beep(sound=1) # integer as argument\n   beep(sound='coin') # string as argument\n\nRequirements\n=============\n\nCurrently, ``beepy`` only runs on Python 3.\n\n``beepy`` relies on a Python package called ``simpleaudio`` which can be also be installed using:\n``pip install simpleaudio``.\n\nInstallation\n=============\n\nTo install, type:\n``pip install beepy``.\n\nArguments\n---------\n\n``sound`` argument takes eitheer integers (1-7) or string (from the list below) as argument.\n\nFollowing are the mappings for the numbers:\n``1`` : ``'coin'``\\ ,\n``2`` : ``'robot_error'``\\ ,\n``3`` : ``'error'``\\ ,\n``4`` : ``'ping'``\\ ,\n``5`` : ``'ready'``\\ ,\n``6`` : ``'success'``\\ ,\n``7`` : ``'wilhelm'``\n\n\nIssues\n------\n\n``beepy`` is currently at  pre-alpha stage.\nBut reports can be posted on Github at a later date.\n\nAuthor\n------\n\n\n* **Prabesh Dhakal** - *Initial Work*\n\nLicence\n-------\n\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License - see the LICENSE.md file for details.\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\n\n* \n  **beepr**\n  The main motivation behind this package is another R package by the name of ``beepr``. I could not find an equivalent for Python, so decided to make my own version of it.\n  You can learn more about ``beepr`` `here <https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/beepr.html>`_.\n\n* \n  **simpleaudio**\n  This package is built on top of another package named `simpleaudio <https://github.com/hamiltron/py-simple-audio>`_, and would not be possible in its absence.\n  While it is largely based on ``simpleaudio``\\ , ``beepy`` is not meant to replace the ``simpleaudio`` package.\n  My sincere thanks to `hamiltron <https://github.com/hamiltron/>`_ for creating simpleaudio.\n\n* \n  **Sound Files**\n  All sound files used in this package come from `freesound.org <https://freesound.org>`_ and were `Creative Commons 0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) <https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/>`_ licenced at the time of creation of this project.\n\n\n","description_content_type":"","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"","keywords":"beep notification sound beepr beeper","license":"MIT","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"beepy","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/beepy/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/beepy/","project_urls":null,"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/beepy/1.0.7/","requires_dist":["simpleaudio"],"requires_python":">=3.0","summary":"Play notification sounds.","version":"1.0.7","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":5625635,"releases":{"1.0.7":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"7c488f1c161e55677333ba3d5d5d3100a6b2b6c04cf542354e774766ff799b39","md5":"56897ef47b48a30acd88b754c485df70","sha256":"0e6616ad678fcf334e57c00633676ffef0ce1232127855fb2fc62c91e67ddb06"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"beepy-1.0.7-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"56897ef47b48a30acd88b754c485df70","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.0","size":1300908,"upload_time":"2019-08-02T18:11:40","upload_time_iso_8601":"2019-08-02T18:11:40.211495Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/7c/48/8f1c161e55677333ba3d5d5d3100a6b2b6c04cf542354e774766ff799b39/beepy-1.0.7-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"7e9b896d524799ae1147bbd00050948b0cc3b4ca225d70eb034864333824c864","md5":"dceabec0d035ae3c97869ce6c5de8789","sha256":"817348ff3cc098aca8d1de7bc15292b762fde20fcc0a020fccea7936940d5b5f"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"beepy-1.0.7.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"dceabec0d035ae3c97869ce6c5de8789","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.0","size":1304126,"upload_time":"2019-08-02T18:11:42","upload_time_iso_8601":"2019-08-02T18:11:42.914324Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/7e/9b/896d524799ae1147bbd00050948b0cc3b4ca225d70eb034864333824c864/beepy-1.0.7.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"7c488f1c161e55677333ba3d5d5d3100a6b2b6c04cf542354e774766ff799b39","md5":"56897ef47b48a30acd88b754c485df70","sha256":"0e6616ad678fcf334e57c00633676ffef0ce1232127855fb2fc62c91e67ddb06"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"beepy-1.0.7-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"56897ef47b48a30acd88b754c485df70","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":">=3.0","size":1300908,"upload_time":"2019-08-02T18:11:40","upload_time_iso_8601":"2019-08-02T18:11:40.211495Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/7c/48/8f1c161e55677333ba3d5d5d3100a6b2b6c04cf542354e774766ff799b39/beepy-1.0.7-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"7e9b896d524799ae1147bbd00050948b0cc3b4ca225d70eb034864333824c864","md5":"dceabec0d035ae3c97869ce6c5de8789","sha256":"817348ff3cc098aca8d1de7bc15292b762fde20fcc0a020fccea7936940d5b5f"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"beepy-1.0.7.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"dceabec0d035ae3c97869ce6c5de8789","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":">=3.0","size":1304126,"upload_time":"2019-08-02T18:11:42","upload_time_iso_8601":"2019-08-02T18:11:42.914324Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/7e/9b/896d524799ae1147bbd00050948b0cc3b4ca225d70eb034864333824c864/beepy-1.0.7.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
