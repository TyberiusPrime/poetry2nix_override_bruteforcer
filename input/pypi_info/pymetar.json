Those reports are called METAR\nreports and are delivered as plain text files that look like this:\n\n```\nDuesseldorf, Germany (EDDL) 51-18N 006-46E 41M\nJul 26, 2002 - 03:50 AM EST / 2002.07.26 0850 UTC\nWind: from the SW (220 degrees) at 9 MPH (8 KT):0\nVisibility: 3 mile(s):0\nSky conditions: mostly cloudy\nWeather: mist\nTemperature: 60 F (16 C)\nDew Point: 57 F (14 C)\nRelative Humidity: 87%\nPressure (altimeter): 30.00 in. Hg (1016 hPa)\nob: EDDL 260850Z 22008KT 5000 BR SCT006 BKN012 16/14 Q1016 BECMG BKN015\ncycle: 9\n```\n\nWhile this is convenient if you just want to quickly look up the data, there's\nsome effort involved in parsing all of this into a format that is digestible by\na program. Plus, you have to remember the base URL of the reports and fetch the\nfile.\n\nThis is what this library does. All you have to do is find the station you're\ninterested in at http://www.aviationweather.gov/metar and feed the 4-letter\nstation code to the MetarReport class.\n\nOn the user end, the library provides a large number of methods to fetch the\nparsed information in a plethora of formats. Those functions are described in\nthe file `librarydoc.txt` which was in turn generated using PyDoc.\n\nPyMETAR uses `urllib2` (and its successors), which in turn makes it easy to honor\nthe environment variable `http_proxy`. This simplifies use of a proxy\ntremendously. Thanks go to Davide Di Blasi for both suggesting and implementing\nthis. The environment variable is easy to use: just set it to:\n\n```\nhttp://username:password@proxy.yourdomain.com:port \n```\n\nYou can also specify a proxy (with the same syntax) as an argument to the\nfetching function. This is sometimes easier when using PyMETAR in a web\napplication environment (such as ZopeWeatherApplet by Jerome Alet). See\n`librarydoc.txt` for details on how to accomplish that. \n\nYou can also use IPs instead of hostnames, of course. When in doubt, ask your\nproxy admin.\n\nDue to some peculiarities in the METAR format, I can not rule out the\npossibility that the library barfs on some less common types of reports. If you\nencounter such a report, please save it and the error messages you get as\ncompletely as possible and send them to me at `klausman-pymetar@schwarzvogel.de`\n--- Thanks a lot!\n\nOf course you may send all the other bugs you encounter to me, too. As this is a\nPython library, chances are that you are Python programmer and can provide a\npatch. If you do so, please, by all means use spaces for indentation, four per\nlevel, that makes merging the patch a lot easier.\n\n## Python 2, 3, PyPy, PyPy3 and so on\n\nThis version of PyMETAR supports Python 3.x and PyPy3 only. The last version to\nhave Python2 as its main target was v0.21.\n\nCompatibility with PyPy (2.x), Jython and other interpreters not mentioned\nabove is unknown.\n\nI maintain a branch (called Python2) on git which is the state of Pymetar as it\nwas for the last version supporting Python 2. That branch is in maintenance\nmode, i.e. it will only receive fixes for security issues or bugs that can be\nfixed without too much fuss. That branch will go away in 2020.\n\n[0]
