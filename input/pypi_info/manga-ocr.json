Please note, that the newest Python release might not be supported due to a PyTorch dependency, which often breaks with new Python releases and needs some time to catch up.\nRefer to [PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for a list of supported Python versions.\n\nSome users have reported problems with Python installed from Microsoft Store. If you see an error:\n`ImportError: DLL load failed while importing fugashi: The specified module could not be found.`,\ntry installing Python from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads).\n\nIf you want to run with GPU, install PyTorch as described [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally),\notherwise this step can be skipped.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n- `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing fugashi: The specified module could not be found.` - might be because of Python installed from Microsoft Store, try installing Python from the [official site](https://www.python.org/downloads)\n- problem with installing `mecab-python3` on ARM architecture - try [this workaround](https://github.com/kha-white/manga-ocr/issues/16)\n\n# Usage\n\n## Python API\n\n```python\nfrom manga_ocr import MangaOcr\n\nmocr = MangaOcr()\ntext = mocr('/path/to/img')\n```\n\nor\n\n```python\nimport PIL.Image\n\nfrom manga_ocr import MangaOcr\n\nmocr = MangaOcr()\nimg = PIL.Image.open('/path/to/img')\ntext = mocr(img)\n```\n\n## Running in the background\n\nManga OCR can run in the background and process new images as they appear.\n\nYou might use a tool like [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) or [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) to manually capture a region of the screen and let the\nOCR read it either from the system clipboard, or a specified directory. By default, Manga OCR will write recognized text to clipboard,\nfrom which it can be read by a dictionary like [Yomichan](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan).\n\nClipboard mode on Linux requires `wl-copy` for Wayland sessions or `xclip` for X11 sessions. You can find out which one your system needs by running `echo $XDG_SESSION_TYPE` in the terminal.\n\nYour full setup for reading manga in Japanese with a dictionary might look like this:\n\ncapture region with ShareX -> write image to clipboard -> Manga OCR -> write text to clipboard -> Yomichan\n\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22717958/150238361-052b95d1-0152-485f-a441-48a957536239.mp4\n\n- To read images from clipboard and write recognized texts to clipboard, run in command line:\n    ```commandline\n    manga_ocr\n    ```\n- To read images from ShareX's screenshot folder, run in command line:\n    ```commandline\n    manga_ocr \"/path/to/sharex/screenshot/folder\"\n    ```\nNote that when running in the clipboard scanning mode, any image that you copy to clipboard will be processed by OCR and replaced\nby recognized text. If you want to be able to copy and paste images as usual, you should use the folder scanning mode instead\nand define a separate task in ShareX just for OCR, which saves screenshots to some folder without copying them to clipboard.\n\nWhen running for the first time, downloading the model (~400 MB) might take a few minutes.\nThe OCR is ready to use after `OCR ready` message appears in the logs.\n\n- To see other options, run in command line:\n    ```commandline\n    manga_ocr --help\n    ```\n\nIf `manga_ocr` doesn't work, you might also try replacing it with `python -m manga_ocr`.\n\n## Usage tips\n\n- OCR supports multi-line text, but the longer the text, the more likely some errors are to occur.\n  If the recognition failed for some part of a longer text, you might try to run it on a smaller portion of the image.\n- The model was trained specifically to handle manga well, but should do a decent job on other types of printed text,\n  such as novels or video games. It probably won't be able to handle handwritten text though. \n- The model always attempts to recognize some text on the image, even if there is none.\n  Because it uses a transformer decoder (and therefore has some understanding of the Japanese language),\n  it might even \"dream up\" some realistically looking sentences! This shouldn't be a problem for most use cases,\n  but it might get improved in the next version.\n\n# Examples\n\nHere are some cherry-picked examples showing the capability of the model. \n\n| image                | Manga OCR result |\n|----------------------|------------------|\n| ![](assets/examples/00.jpg) | 素直にあやまるしか |\n| ![](assets/examples/01.jpg) | 立川で見た〝穴〟の下の巨大な眼は： |\n| ![](assets/examples/02.jpg) | 実戦剣術も一流です |\n| ![](assets/examples/03.jpg) | 第３０話重苦しい闇の奥で静かに呼吸づきながら |\n| ![](assets/examples/04.jpg) | よかったじゃないわよ！何逃げてるのよ！！早くあいつを退治してよ！ |\n| ![](assets/examples/05.jpg) | ぎゃっ |\n| ![](assets/examples/06.jpg) | ピンポーーン |\n| ![](assets/examples/07.jpg) | ＬＩＮＫ！私達７人の力でガノンの塔の結界をやぶります |\n| ![](assets/examples/08.jpg) | ファイアパンチ |\n| ![](assets/examples/09.jpg) | 少し黙っている |\n| ![](assets/examples/10.jpg) | わかるかな〜？ |\n| ![](assets/examples/11.jpg) | 警察にも先生にも町中の人達に！！ |\n\n# Contact\nFor any inquiries, please feel free to contact me at kha-white@mail.com\n\n# Acknowledgments\n\nThis project was done with the usage of:\n- [Manga109-s](http://www.manga109.org/en/download_s.html) dataset\n- [CC-100](https://data.statmt.org/cc-100/) dataset\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":null,"downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":null,"keywords":null,"license":"Apache License Version 2.0, January 2004 http://www.apache.org/licenses/  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION  1.
