For more\ninformation, see the ASPN terms of service here:\n\n<http://code.activestate.com/help/terms/>\n\nWhile the licensing under the PSF license is sub-optimal, it is what it is. See\n<http://docs.python.org/license.html> for more information about the PSF\nlicense.\n\nWhat this is\n------------------\nThis module is designed to be a python equivalent to the `java.util.Properties <http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html>`_ class. \nCurrently, the basic input/output methods are supported, and there are plans \nto add the XML input/output methods found in J2SE 5.0.\n\nFundamentally, this module is designed so that users can easily parse and \nmanipulate Java Properties files - that's it. There's a fair number of us \npythonistas who work in multi-language shops, and constantly writing your own \nparsing mechanism is just painful. Not to mention Java guys are notoriously \nunwilling to use anything which is cross-language for configuration, unless\nit's XML, which is a form of self-punishment. :)\n\nPlans\n------------------\nHere is a rough plan of features:\n\n- Keep/maintain blank lines and comments found in the original file\n- Make the module compatible with the new methods in J2SE 5.0\n- Switch to/add python property access rather than direct dictionary get/set\n- Add unit tests\n- Add unicode support\n- When-Pigs-Fly: If running within Jython, switch to java.util.Properties\n  under the hood\n- Coercion/conversion to python types for values \n\nUsage\n------------------\nThis is the easy part::\n\n    from pyjavaproperties3 import Properties\n    p = Properties()\n    p.load(open('test2.properties'))\n    p.list()\n    print p\n    print p.items()\n    print p['name3']\n    p['name3'] = 'changed = value'\n    print p['name3']    \n    p['new key'] = 'new value'\n    p.store(open('test2.properties','w'))\n\nSee also the Properties.list() method, which will return an iterator over the\nproperty keys\n\nChanges & News\n--------------\n0.6: \n    - Fix license, whitespace.\n\n0.4:\n    - Patch from Pepper Lebeck-Jobe for handling ! style comments.\n\n0.3:\n    - Keys that are added which were not part of the original file\n      are simply appended to the index. Shenanigans.\n\n0.2:\n    - Added an internal list (self._keyorder) to keep an ordered index of keys\n      as they are encountered, so the file can we written-back out in the \n      same order.\n\n0.1:\n    - Initial release/fork. \n    - Added setup/packaging and doc \n    - added in {foo} style references for previous properties, thanks to N B\n      on ASPN.\n\n","description_content_type":"","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyjavaproperties3","keywords":"","license":"PSF License","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"pyjavaproperties3","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/pyjavaproperties3/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/pyjavaproperties3/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyjavaproperties3"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/pyjavaproperties3/0.6/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":"","summary":"Python 3 replacement for java.util.Properties.","version":"0.6","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":4649415,"releases":{"0.6":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"92a60e86b70cec1aa5a8aa1923ed792e500c4b68633360dc3606f812476575cf","md5":"fae5329782c227aabe82001729bc0ced","sha256":"668656f36ec6192944f5d0c99eee6a3e3945e669b052d8fd8ccb9cb29aae2500"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"pyjavaproperties3-0.6-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"fae5329782c227aabe82001729bc0ced","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":null,"size":7440,"upload_time":"2019-01-01T03:04:08","upload_time_iso_8601":"2019-01-01T03:04:08.285126Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/92/a6/0e86b70cec1aa5a8aa1923ed792e500c4b68633360dc3606f812476575cf/pyjavaproperties3-0.6-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"e5872def1c5f4d92df1bb929833b0075d3b1cf118c27d13174e92148cfb13486","md5":"5896b9d313654bfd4d76d040253afc00","sha256":"19a60b02654c2e1eaaaf386c98b14b7b7808bdb04341d9d2fd00498dd080ee87"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"pyjavaproperties3-0.6.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"5896b9d313654bfd4d76d040253afc00","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":7640,"upload_time":"2019-01-01T03:04:10","upload_time_iso_8601":"2019-01-01T03:04:10.538443Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e5/87/2def1c5f4d92df1bb929833b0075d3b1cf118c27d13174e92148cfb13486/pyjavaproperties3-0.6.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"92a60e86b70cec1aa5a8aa1923ed792e500c4b68633360dc3606f812476575cf","md5":"fae5329782c227aabe82001729bc0ced","sha256":"668656f36ec6192944f5d0c99eee6a3e3945e669b052d8fd8ccb9cb29aae2500"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"pyjavaproperties3-0.6-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"fae5329782c227aabe82001729bc0ced","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":null,"size":7440,"upload_time":"2019-01-01T03:04:08","upload_time_iso_8601":"2019-01-01T03:04:08.285126Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/92/a6/0e86b70cec1aa5a8aa1923ed792e500c4b68633360dc3606f812476575cf/pyjavaproperties3-0.6-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"e5872def1c5f4d92df1bb929833b0075d3b1cf118c27d13174e92148cfb13486","md5":"5896b9d313654bfd4d76d040253afc00","sha256":"19a60b02654c2e1eaaaf386c98b14b7b7808bdb04341d9d2fd00498dd080ee87"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"pyjavaproperties3-0.6.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"5896b9d313654bfd4d76d040253afc00","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":7640,"upload_time":"2019-01-01T03:04:10","upload_time_iso_8601":"2019-01-01T03:04:10.538443Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/e5/87/2def1c5f4d92df1bb929833b0075d3b1cf118c27d13174e92148cfb13486/pyjavaproperties3-0.6.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
