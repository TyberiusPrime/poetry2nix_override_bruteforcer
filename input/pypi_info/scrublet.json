For details and validation of the method, see our paper in [Cell Systems](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471218304745) or the preprint on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/07/09/357368).\n\n#### Quick start:\nFor a typical workflow, including interpretation of predicted doublet scores, see the example [notebook](./examples/scrublet_basics.ipynb).  \n\nGiven a raw (unnormalized) UMI counts matrix `counts_matrix` with cells as rows and genes as columns, calculate a doublet score for each cell: \n```python\nimport scrublet as scr\nscrub = scr.Scrublet(counts_matrix)\ndoublet_scores, predicted_doublets = scrub.scrub_doublets()\n```\n`scr.scrub_doublets()` simulates doublets from the observed data and uses a k-nearest-neighbor classifier to calculate a continuous `doublet_score` (between 0 and 1) for each transcriptome. The score is automatically thresholded to generate `predicted_doublets`, a boolean array that is `True` for predicted doublets and `False` otherwise. \n\n#### Best practices:  \n- When working with data from multiple samples, run Scrublet on each sample separately. Because Scrublet is designed to detect technical doublets formed by the random co-encapsulation of two cells, it may perform poorly on merged datasets where the cell type proportions are not representative of any single sample. \n- Check that the doublet score threshold is reasonable (in an ideal case, separating the two peaks of a bimodal simulated doublet score histogram, as in [this example](./examples/scrublet_basics.ipynb)), and adjust manually if necessary.\n- Visualize the doublet predictions in a 2-D embedding (e.g., UMAP or t-SNE). Predicted doublets should mostly co-localize (possibly in multiple clusters). If they do not, you may need to adjust the doublet score threshold, or change the pre-processing parameters to better resolve the cell states present in your data.\n\n#### Installation:\nTo install with PyPI:\n```bash\npip install scrublet\n```\n\nTo install from source:\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/swolock/scrublet.git\ncd scrublet\npip install -r requirements.txt\npip install --upgrade .\n```\n\n#### Old versions:\nPrevious versions can be found [here](./old_versions/).\n\n#### Other doublet detection
