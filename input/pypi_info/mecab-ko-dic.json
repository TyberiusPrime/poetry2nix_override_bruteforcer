We also know that MeCab\nwasn't designed for Korean. But it gives us the kind of tokens we need better\nthan other things we've tried.\n\nOne reason we're packaging this is to use it in [wordfreq][], which needs to\nhave a reasonable set of consistent tokens so it can look up their frequencies,\nand already uses MeCab for Japanese.\n\n[wordfreq]: https://github.com/LuminosoInsight/wordfreq\n\nIf interoperability with things that already use MeCab is not your goal, you\nprobably have better options for Korean NLP than this.\n\n\n## Credits\n\nThe dictionary data was created by Yongwoon Lee and Yungho Yu. We've included it\nas part of this package under the terms of the Apache License 2.0. The original\ndictionary can be found [here][original-dict].\n\nThe idea to package a MeCab dictionary as a Python repository, as well as the\ncode structure for doing so, come from [Paul McCann's ipadic package][ipadic-py].\n\n[original-dict]: https://bitbucket.org/eunjeon/mecab-ko-dic/\n[ipadic-py]: https://github.com/polm/ipadic-py\n\n\n## Usage\n\nTo install:\n\n    pip install mecab-ko-dic\n\nTo initialize with mecab-python3:\n\n    import MeCab\n    import mecab_ko_dic\n    tagger = MeCab.Tagger(mecab_ko_dic.MECAB_ARGS)\n    print(tagger.parse(\"안녕하세요세계.\"))\n\n\n## License\n\nThe data we use, and this code repository itself, are released under the Apache\nLicense 2.0.
