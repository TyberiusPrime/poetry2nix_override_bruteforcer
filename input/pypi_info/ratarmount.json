Not shown in the benchmarks, but ratarmount can mount files with **preexisting index sidecar files** in under a second making it **vastly more efficient** compared to archivemount for every **subsequent mount**.\n   Also, archivemount has no progress indicator making it very unlikely the user will wait hours for the mounting to finish.\n   Fuse-archive, an iteration on archivemount, has the `--asyncprogress` option to give a progress indicator using the timestamp of a dummy file.\n   Note that fuse-archive daemonizes instantly but the mount point will not be usable for a long time and everything trying to use it will hang until then when not using `--asyncprogress`!\n - **Getting file contents** of a mounted archive is generally **vastly faster** than archivemount and fuse-archive and does not increase with the archive size or file count resulting in the largest observed speedups to be around 5 orders of magnitude!\n - **Memory consumption** of ratarmount is mostly **less** than archivemount and mostly does not grow with the archive size.\n   Not shown in the plots, but the memory usage will be much smaller when not specifying `-P 0`, i.e., when not parallelizing.\n   The gzip backend grows linearly with the archive size because the data for seeking is thousands of times larger than the simple two 64-bit offsets required for bzip2.\n   The memory usage of the zstd backend only seems humongous because it uses `mmap` to open.\n   The memory used by `mmap` is not even counted as used memory when showing the memory usage with `free` or `htop`.\n - For empty files, mounting with ratarmount and archivemount does not seem be bounded by decompression nor I/O bandwidths but instead by the algorithm for creating the internal file index.\n   This algorithm scales **linearly** for ratarmount and fuse-archive but seems to scale worse than even quadratically for archives containing more than 1M files when using archivemount.\n   Ratarmount 0.10.0 improves upon earlier versions by batching SQLite insertions.\n - Mounting **bzip2** and **xz** archives has actually become **faster** than archivemount and fuse-archive with `ratarmount -P 0` on most modern processors because it actually uses more than one core for decoding those compressions. `indexed_bzip2` supports block **parallel decoding** since version 1.2.0.\n - **Gzip** compressed TAR files are two times slower than archivemount during first time mounting.\n   It is not totally clear to me why that is because streaming the file contents after the archive being mounted is comparably fast, see the next benchmarks below.\n   In order to have superior speeds for both of these, I am [experimenting](https://github.com/mxmlnkn/indexed_bzip2/tree/parallelgz) with a parallelized gzip decompressor like the prototype [pugz](https://github.com/Piezoid/pugz) offers for non-binary files only.\n - For the other cases, mounting times become roughly the same compared to archivemount for archives with 2M files in an approximately 100GB archive.\n - **Getting a lot of metadata** for archive contents as demonstrated by calling `find` on the mount point is an order of magnitude **slower** compared to archivemount. Because the C-based fuse-archive is even slower than ratarmount, the difference is very likely that archivemount uses the low-level FUSE interface while ratarmount and fuse-archive use the high-level FUSE interface.\n\n\n![Reading bandwidth benchmark comparison between ratarmount, archivemount, and fuse-archive](benchmarks/plots/bandwidth-comparison.png)\n\n - Reading files from the archive with archivemount are scaling quadratically instead of linearly.\n   This is because archivemount starts reading from the beginning of the archive for each requested I/O block.\n   The block size depends on the program or operating system and should be in the order of 4 kiB.\n   Meaning, the scaling is `O( (sizeOfFileToBeCopiedFromArchive / readChunkSize)^2 )`.\n   Both, ratarmount and fuse-archive avoid this behavior.\n   Because of this quadratic scaling, the average bandwidth with archivemount seems like it decreases with the file size.\n - Reading bz2 and xz are both an order of magnitude faster, as tested on my 12/24-core Ryzen 3900X, thanks to parallelization.\n - Memory is bounded in these tests for all programs but ratarmount is a lot more lax with memory because it uses a Python stack and because it needs to hold caches for a constant amount of blocks for parallel decoding of bzip2 and xz files.\n   The zstd backend in ratarmount looks unbounded because it uses mmap, whose memory usage will automatically stop and be freed if the memory limit has been reached.\n - The peak for the xz decoder reading speeds happens because some blocks will be cached when loading the index, which is not included in the benchmark for technical reasons. The value for the 1 GiB file size is more realistic.\n\n\nFurther benchmarks can be viewed [here](benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md).\n\n\n# The Problem\n\nYou downloaded a large TAR file from the internet, for example the [1.31TB](http://academictorrents.com/details/564a77c1e1119da199ff32622a1609431b9f1c47) large [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/), and you now want to use it but lack the space, time, or a file system fast enough to extract all the 14.2 million image files.\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>Existing Partial Solutions</summary>\n\n## Partial Solutions\n\n### Archivemount\n\n[Archivemount](https://github.com/cybernoid/archivemount/) seems to have large performance issues for too many files and large archive for both mounting and file access in version 0.8.7. A more in-depth comparison benchmark can be found [here](benchmarks/BENCHMARKS.md).\n\n  - Mounting the 6.5GB ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2012 validation data set, and then testing the speed with: `time cat mounted/ILSVRC2012_val_00049975.JPEG | wc -c` takes 250ms for archivemount and 2ms for ratarmount.\n  - Trying to mount the 150GB [ILSVRC object localization data set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imagenet-object-localization-challenge) containing 2 million images was given up upon after 2 hours. Ratarmount takes ~15min to create a ~150MB index and <1ms for opening an already created index (SQLite database) and mounting the TAR. In contrast, archivemount will take the same amount of time even for subsequent mounts.\n  - Does not support recursive mounting. Although, you could write a script to stack archivemount on top of archivemount for all contained TAR files.\n\n### Tarindexer\n\n[Tarindex](https://github.com/devsnd/tarindexer) is a command line to tool written in Python which can create index files and then use the index file to extract single files from the tar fast. However, it also has some caveats which ratarmount tries to solve:\n\n  - It only works with single files, meaning it would be necessary to loop over the extract-call. But this would require loading the possibly quite large tar index file into memory each time. For example for ImageNet, the resulting index file is hundreds of MB large. Also, extracting directories will be a hassle.\n  - It's difficult to integrate tarindexer into other production environments. Ratarmount instead uses FUSE to mount the TAR as a folder readable by any other programs requiring access to the contained data.\n  - Can't handle TARs recursively. In order to extract files inside a TAR which itself is inside a TAR, the packed TAR first needs to be extracted.\n\n\n### TAR Browser\n\nI didn't find out about [TAR Browser](https://github.com/tomorrow-nf/tar-as-filesystem/) before I finished the ratarmount script. That's also one of it's cons:\n\n  - Hard to find. I don't seem to be the only one who has trouble finding it as it has one star on Github after 7 years compared to 45 stars for tarindexer after roughly the same amount of time.\n  - Hassle to set up. Needs compilation and I gave up when I was instructed to set up a MySQL database for it to use. Confusingly, the setup instructions are not on its Github but [here](https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-030615-133259/unrestricted/TARBrowserFinal.pdf).\n  - Doesn't seem to support recursive TAR mounting. I didn't test it because of the MysQL dependency but the code does not seem to have logic for recursive mounting.\n  - Xz compression also is only block or frame based, i.e., only works faster with files created by [pixz](https://github.com/vasi/pixz) or [pxz](https://github.com/jnovy/pxz).\n\nPros:\n  - supports bz2- and xz-compressed TAR archives\n\n</details>\n\n## The Solution\n\nRatarmount creates an index file with file names, ownership, permission flags, and offset information.\nThis sidecar is stored at the TAR file's location or in `~/.ratarmount/`.\nRatarmount can load that index file in under a second if it exists and then offers FUSE mount integration for easy access to the files inside the archive.\n\nHere is a more recent test for version 0.2.0 with the new default SQLite backend:\n\n  - TAR size: 124GB\n  - Contains TARs: yes\n  - Files in TAR: 1000\n  - Files in TAR (including recursively in contained TARs): 1.26 million\n  - Index creation (first mounting): 15m 39s\n  - Index size: 146MB\n  - Index loading (subsequent mounting): 0.000s\n  - Reading a 64kB file: ~4ms\n  - Running 'find mountPoint -type f | wc -l' (1.26M stat calls): 1m 50s\n\nThe reading time for a small file simply verifies the random access by using file seek to be working. The difference between the first read and subsequent reads is not because of ratarmount but because of operating system and file system caches.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Older test with 1.31 TB Imagenet (Fall 2011 release)</summary>\n\nThe test with the first version of ratarmount ([50e8dbb](https://github.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount/commit/50e8dbb10696d51de2e613dee560662be580cbd4)), which used the, as of now removed, pickle backend for serializing the metadata index, for the [ImageNet data set](https://academictorrents.com/details/564a77c1e1119da199ff32622a1609431b9f1c47):\n\n  - TAR size: 1.31TB\n  - Contains TARs: yes\n  - Files in TAR: ~26 000\n  - Files in TAR (including recursively in contained TARs): 14.2 million\n  - Index creation (first mounting): 4 hours\n  - Index size: 1GB\n  - Index loading (subsequent mounting): 80s\n  - Reading a 40kB file: 100ms (first time) and 4ms (subsequent times)\n\nIndex loading is relatively slow with 80s because of the pickle backend, which now has been replaced with SQLite and should take less than a second now.\n\n</details>\n\n\n# Usage\n\n## Command Line Options\n\nSee `ratarmount --help` or [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxmlnkn/ratarmount/master/tests/ratarmount-help.txt).\n\n## Metadata Index Cache\n\nIn order to reduce the mounting time, the created index for random access\nto files inside the tar will be saved to one of these locations. These\nlocations are checked in order and the first, which works sufficiently, will\nbe used. This is the default location order:\n\n  1. <path to tar>.index.sqlite\n  2. ~/.ratarmount/<path to tar: '/' -> '_'>.index.sqlite\n     E.g., ~/.ratarmount/_media_cdrom_programm.tar.index.sqlite\n\nThis list of fallback folders can be overwritten using the `--index-folders`\noption. Furthermore, an explicitly named index file may be specified using\nthe `--index-file` option. If `--index-file` is used, then the fallback\nfolders, including the default ones, will be ignored!\n\n## Bind Mounting\n\nThe mount sources can be TARs and/or folders.  Because of that, ratarmount\ncan also be used to bind mount folders read-only to another path similar to\n`bindfs` and `mount --bind`. So, for:\n\n    ratarmount folder mountpoint\n\nall files in `folder` will now be visible in mountpoint.\n\n## Union Mounting\n\nIf multiple mount sources are specified, the sources on the right side will be\nadded to or update existing files from a mount source left of it. For example:\n\n    ratarmount folder1 folder2 mountpoint\n\nwill make both, the files from folder1 and folder2, visible in mountpoint.\nIf a file exists in both multiple source, then the file from the rightmost\nmount source will be used, which in the above example would be `folder2`.\n\nIf you want to update / overwrite a folder with the contents of a given TAR,\nyou can specify the folder both as a mount source and as the mount point:\n\n    ratarmount folder file.tar folder\n\nThe FUSE option -o nonempty will be automatically added if such a usage is\ndetected. If you instead want to update a TAR with a folder, you only have to\nswap the two mount sources:\n\n    ratarmount file.tar folder folder\n\n## File versions\n\nIf a file exists multiple times in a TAR or in multiple mount sources, then\nthe hidden versions can be accessed through special <file>.versions folders.\nFor example, consider:\n\n    ratarmount folder updated.tar mountpoint\n\nand the file `foo` exists both in the folder and as two different versions\nin `updated.tar`. Then, you can list all three versions using:\n\n    ls -la mountpoint/foo.versions/\n        dr-xr-xr-x 2 user group     0 Apr 25 21:41 .\n        dr-x------ 2 user group 10240 Apr 26 15:59 ..\n        -r-x------ 2 user group   123 Apr 25 21:41 1\n        -r-x------ 2 user group   256 Apr 25 21:53 2\n        -r-x------ 2 user group  1024 Apr 25 22:13 3\n\nIn this example, the oldest version has only 123 bytes while the newest and\nby default shown version has 1024 bytes. So, in order to look at the oldest\nversion, you can simply do:\n\n    cat mountpoint/foo.versions/1\n\nNote that these version numbers are the same as when used with tar's\n`--occurrence=N` option.\n\n## Prefix Removal\n\nUse `ratarmount -o modules=subdir,subdir=<prefix>` to remove path prefixes\nusing the FUSE `subdir` module. Because it is a standard FUSE feature, the\n`-o ...` argument should also work for other FUSE applications.\n\nWhen mounting an archive created with absolute paths, e.g.,\n`tar -P cf /var/log/apt/history.log`, you would see the whole `var/log/apt`\nhierarchy under the mount point. To avoid that, specified prefixes can be\nstripped from paths so that the mount target directory **directly** contains\n`history.log`. Use `ratarmount -o modules=subdir,subdir=/var/log/apt/` to do\nso. The specified path to the folder inside the TAR will be mounted to root,\ni.e., the mount point.\n\n## Compressed non-TAR files\n\nIf you want a compressed file not containing a TAR, e.g., `foo.bz2`, then\nyou can also use ratarmount for that. The uncompressed view will then be\nmounted to `<mountpoint>/foo` and you will be able to leverage ratarmount's\nseeking capabilities when opening that file.\n\n## Xz and Zst Files\n\nIn contrast to bzip2 and gzip compressed files, true seeking on xz and zst files is only possible at block or frame boundaries.\nThis wouldn't be noteworthy, if both standard compressors for [xz](https://tukaani.org/xz/) and [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) were not by default creating unsuited files.\nEven though both file formats do support multiple frames and xz even contains a frame table at the end for easy seeking, both compressors write only a single frame and/or block out, making this feature unusable.\nIn order to generate truly seekable compressed files, you'll have to use [pixz](https://github.com/vasi/pixz) for xz files.\nFor zstd compressed, you can try with [t2sz](https://github.com/martinellimarco/t2sz).\nThe standard zstd tool does not support setting smaller block sizes yet although an [issue](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/issues/2121) does exist.\nAlternatively, you can simply split the original file into parts, compress those parts, and then concatenate those parts together to get a suitable multiframe zst file.\nHere is a bash function, which can be used for that:\n\n<details>\n<summary>Bash script: createMultiFrameZstd</summary>\n\n```bash\ncreateMultiFrameZstd()\n(\n    # Detect being piped into\n    if [ -t 0 ]; then\n        file=$1\n        frameSize=$2\n        if [[ ! -f \"$file\" ]]; then echo \"Could not find file '$file'.\" 1>&2; return 1; fi\n        fileSize=$( stat -c %s -- \"$file\" )\n    else\n        if [ -t 1 ]; then echo 'You should pipe the output to somewhere!' 1>&2; return 1; fi\n        echo 'Will compress from stdin...' 1>&2\n        frameSize=$1\n    fi\n    if [[ ! $frameSize =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then\n        echo \"Frame size '$frameSize' is not a valid number.\" 1>&2\n        return 1\n    fi\n\n    # Create a temporary file. I avoid simply piping to zstd\n    # because it wouldn't store the uncompressed size.\n    if [[ -d /dev/shm ]]; then frameFile=$( mktemp --tmpdir=/dev/shm ); fi\n    if [[ -z $frameFile ]]; then frameFile=$( mktemp ); fi\n    if [[ -z $frameFile ]]; then\n        echo \"Could not create a temporary file for the frames.\" 1>&2\n        return 1\n    fi\n\n    if [ -t 0 ]; then\n        true > \"$file.zst\"\n        for (( offset = 0; offset < fileSize; offset += frameSize )); do\n            dd if=\"$file\" of=\"$frameFile\" bs=$(( 1024*1024 )) \\\n               iflag=skip_bytes,count_bytes skip=\"$offset\" count=\"$frameSize\" 2>/dev/null\n            zstd -c -q -- \"$frameFile\" >> \"$file.zst\"\n        done\n    else\n        while true; do\n            dd of=\"$frameFile\" bs=$(( 1024*1024 )) \\\n               iflag=count_bytes count=\"$frameSize\" 2>/dev/null\n            # pipe is finished when reading it yields no further data\n            if [[ ! -s \"$frameFile\" ]]; then break; fi\n            zstd -c -q -- \"$frameFile\"\n        done\n    fi\n\n    'rm' -f -- \"$frameFile\"\n)\n```\n\nIn order to compress a file named `foo` into a multiframe zst file called `foo.zst`, which contains frames sized 4MiB of uncompressed ata, you would call it like this:\n\n```bash\ncreateMultiFrameZstd foo  $(( 4*1024*1024 ))\n```\n\nIt also works when being piped to. This can be useful for recompressing files to avoid having to decompress them first to disk.\n\n```bash\nlbzip2 -cd well-compressed-file.bz2 | createMultiFrameZstd $(( 4*1024*1024 )) > recompressed.zst\n```\n\n</details>\n\n\n# Writable Mounting\n\nThe  `--write-overlay <folder>` option can be used to create a writable mount point.\nThe original archive will not be modified.\n\n - File creations will create these files in the specified overlay folder.\n - File deletions and renames will be registered in a database that also resides in the overlay folder.\n - File modifications will copy the file from the archive into the overlay folder before applying the modification.\n\nThis overlay folder can be stored alongside the archive or it can be deleted after unmounting the archive.\nThis is useful when building the executable from a source tarball without extracting.\nAfter installation, the intermediary build files residing in the overlay folder can be safely removed.\n\nIf it is desired to apply the modifications to the original archive, then the `--commit-overlay` can be prepended to the original ratarmount call.\n\nHere is an example for applying modifications to a writable mount and then committing those modifications back to the archive:\n\n 1. Mount it with a write overlay and add new files. The original archive is not modified.\n    ```bash\n    ratarmount --write-overlay example-overlay example.tar example-mount-point\n    echo \"Hello World\" > example-mount-point/new-file.txt\n    ```\n\n 2. Unmount. Changes persist solely in the overlay folder.\n    ```bash\n    fusermount -u example-mount-point\n    ```\n\n 3. Commit changes to the original archive.\n    ```bash\n    ratarmount --commit-overlay --write-overlay example-overlay example.tar example-mount-point\n    ```\n    Output:\n    ```bash\n    To commit the overlay folder to the archive, these commands have to be executed:\n    \n        tar --delete --null --verbatim-files-from --files-from='/tmp/tmp_ajfo8wf/deletions.lst' \\\n            --file 'example.tar' 2>&1 |\n           sed '/^tar: Exiting with failure/d; /^tar.*Not found in archive/d'\n        tar --append -C 'zlib-wiki-overlay' --null --verbatim-files-from --files-from='/tmp/tmp_ajfo8wf/append.lst' --file 'example.tar'\n    \n    Committing is an experimental feature!\n    Please confirm by entering \"commit\". Any other input will cancel.\n    > \n    Committed successfully. You can now remove the overlay folder at example-overlay.\n    ```\n\n 4. Verify the modifications to the original archive.\n    ```bash\n    tar -tvlf example.tar\n    ```\n    Output:\n    ```\n    -rw-rw-r-- user/user 652817 2022-08-08 10:44 example.txt\n    -rw-rw-r-- user/user     12 2023-02-16 09:49 new-file.txt\n    ```\n\n 5. Remove the obsole write overlay folder.\n    ```bash\n    rm -r example-overlay\n    ```\n\n## As a Library\n\nRatarmount can also be used as a library.\nUsing [ratarmountcore](core/), files inside archives can be accessed directly from Python code without requiring FUSE.\nFor a more detailed description, see the [ratarmountcore readme
