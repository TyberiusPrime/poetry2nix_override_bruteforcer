It provides constants for\nNot-a-Number (NaN), Positive Infinity (PosInf), and Negative Infinity\n(NegInf), as well as functions to test for these values.\n\nThe code is implemented in pure python by taking advantage of the\n'struct' standard module. Care has been taken to generate proper\nresults on both big-endian and little-endian machines. Some efficiency\ncould be gained by translating the core routines into C.\n\nSee <http://babbage.cs.qc.edu/courses/cs341/IEEE-754references.html>\nfor reference material on the IEEE 754 floating point standard.\n\nFurther information on this package is available at\n<http://www.analytics.washington.edu/statcomp/projects/rzope/fpconst/>.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nAuthor:    Gregory R.
