This randomizer is designed to\nrandomize colors according to their groupings. For example, all colors that\nrepresent grass will be randomized with the same logic, whereas water's colors\nwill be randomized with different logic. This creates a consistent color scheme\nwithout any disconnects in colors (e.g. grass having two different colors).\n\nA set of colors is randomized according to the following rules:\n\n- Shift a color's hue by at least 2.5%. This ensures a color is actually changed.\n- If increasing saturation, do so very gently and proportional to current value.\n- Saturation is okay to be reduced all the way to zero.\n- Increasing brightness is similar increasing saturation.\n- If a lot of saturation was removed, allow increasing the brightness slightly\n  more.\n- If reducing brightness, do so by no more than half (this may be restricted\n  further in the future).\n\n![example1](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/329059206030295051/641420281608405022/unknown.png)\n![example2](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/329059206030295051/641445510074466304/unknown.png)\n\n## Advantages over other palette randomizers\n\nWhile [Link to the Past Randomizer](https://alttpr.com) already has a built-in\npalette randomizer, it does not take the necessary care to ensure every palette\ncan be randomized. Certain items like houses and rocks are never randomized.\nFurther, the overworld palette randomizer does not have as much control as this\napp does, which allows for much richer variety of colors.\n\nTODO: Add pictures\n\n- The overworld map palette is updated to reflect the new overworld palette.\n- Sprite palettes of rocks and bushes match their object palettes.\n- Ice golem palettes match Ice Palace palettes.\n\n![example3](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/329059206030295051/712227454248550450/unknown.png?width=783&height=684)\n![example4](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/329059206030295051/712228332552323112/unknown.png?width=783&height=684)\n![example5](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/329059206030295051/712383831268786216/unknown.png?width=782&height=684)\n\n## How to use\n\nGo to our [Releases](https://github.com/Maseya/z3pr-py/releases)\npage. From there, download _z3pr.zip_ under the _Assets_ tab of\nthe latest release.\n\nOr you can install it through pip with `pip install --user maseya.z3pr`\n\nIt is recommended that your logic randomizer app keep the vanilla palette, or\nyou may still experience ugly colors after using this app.\n\nThe following command-line arguments are supported by the app:\n\n```text\n[args...] inputFile <outputFile>\n\ninputFile           Input path of ROM. Required\n\noutputFile          Output destination. Optional\n                    If no path is specified, the app will\n                    decide an appropriate file name.\n\nargs:\n-w --overworld      Randomize overworld palettes. Default\n-W --no-overworld   Do not randomize overworld palettes.\n\n-d --dungeon        Randomize dungeon palettes. Default\n-D --no-dungeon     Do not randomize dungeon palettes.\n\n-l --link-sprite    Randomize Link sprite palette.\n-L --no-link-sprite Do not randomize Link sprite palette. Default\n\n--sword             Randomize sword palettes.\n--no-sword          Do not randomize sword palettes. Default\n\n--shield            Randomize shield palettes.\n--no-shield         Do not randomize shield palettes. Default\n\n--hud               Randomize HUD palettes.\n--no-hud            Do not randomize HUD palettes. Default\n\n--seed=value        Use specific seed for random generator.\n                    Hex is supported with \"0x\" prefix. Default value\n                    is -1, which specifies not using predetermined\n                    seed.\n\n--data-dir=value    Read JSON offset files from custom directory.\n\n--mode=value        None: Makes no changes to rom.\n\n                    Default: Default color mixing algorithm.\n                    Maseya: Same as \"Default\".\n\n                    Negative: Invert all colors.\n\n                    Grayscale: Desaturate all colors.\n\n                    Blackout: Set all colors to black.\n\n                    Classic: Randomize palette similar to classic web API.\n                        Produces less aesthetic colors if that's your thing.\n\n                    Dizzy: Randomize each color without logic but preserve\n                        saturation and lightness.\n\n                    Sick: Randomize each color without logic but preserve\n                        lightness.\n\n                    Puke: Randomize each color without logic.\n```\n\nYou can override the default arguments in the `args.config` file located\nin the application folder.\n\n## Contributions\n\nDo you want to add a feature, report a bug, or propose a change to the\nproject?
