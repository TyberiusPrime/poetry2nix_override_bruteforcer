This may be a local file, or a URL.\n\nThere's an optional second argument, block, which is set to True by default. Setting it to False makes the function run asynchronously.\n\nOn Windows, uses windll.winmm. WAVE and MP3 have been tested and are known to work. Other file formats may work as well.\n\nOn OS X, uses AppKit.NSSound. WAVE and MP3 have been tested and are known to work. In general, anything QuickTime can play, playsound should be able to play, for OS X.\n\nOn Linux, uses GStreamer. Known to work on Ubuntu 14.04 and ElementaryOS Loki. I expect any Linux distro with a standard gnome desktop experience should work.\n\nIf you'd like other Linux distros (or any other OS) to work, submit a PR adding in support for it, but please make sure it passes the tests (see below).\n\nTesting\n-------\nPlaysound includes a small set of tests - if you're making a PR, please ensure that you have no regressions and all the tests pass on your local system.\nAlso make sure that Travis-CI, which runs these tests against Windows Server 2016, macOS 10.11 (El Capitan, 2015) and 11.3 (Big Sur, 2020), Ubuntu 14 (Trusty), and Ubuntu 18 (Bionic), for both Python 2.7 and 3.9, fully passes.\nYou can check the Travis-CI status for Playsound here: https://travis-ci.com/github/TaylorSMarks/playsound/builds\n\nCopyright\n---------\nThis software is
