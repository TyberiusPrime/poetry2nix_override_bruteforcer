If your system doesn't come with a python distribution, it can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/downloads/ or https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html.\n- `pip` is optional but it makes the installation a bit easier.\n\n```sh\n# install released version\npip3 install -U radian\n# to run radian\nradian\n```\n\n```sh\n# or the development version\npip3 install -U git+https://github.com/randy3k/radian\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you use conda or miniconda,\n```sh\nconda install -c conda-forge radian\n```\nIn this case, it is recommended to install R via conda to ensure consistency in C runtime libraries.\n\n## Alias on unix system\n\nYou could alias `r` to _radian_ by putting\n\n```bash\nalias r=\"radian\"\n```\nin `~/.bash_profile` such that `r` would open _radian_ and `R` would still open the traditional R console.\n(`R` is still useful, e.g, running `R CMD BUILD`.)\n\n\n## Settings\n\n_radian_ can be customized by specifying the below options in various locations\n\n- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/radian/profile` or `$HOME/.config/radian/profile` (Unix)\n- `%USERPROFILE%/radian/profile` (Windows)\n- `$HOME/.radian_profile` (Unix)\n- `%USERPROFILE%/.radian_profile` (Windows)\n- `.radian_profile` in the working directory\n\nThe options could be also specified in the `.Rprofile` files, however,\nit is not recommended because \n\n1. the settings are not persistent when vanilla mode is used;\n2. it doesn't work well with `packrat` or `renv`.\n\n\n```r\n# Do not copy the whole configuration, just specify what you need!\n# see

through the terminal.\n# In the following example, `esc` + `-` sends `<-` and `ctrl` + `right` sends `%>%`.\n# Note that in some terminals, you could mark `alt` as `escape` so you could use `alt` + `-` instead.\n# Also, note that some ctrl mappings are reserved. You cannot remap m, i, h, d, or c\noptions(\n    radian.escape_key_map = list(\n        list(key = \"-\", value = \" <- \"),\n    ),\n    radian.ctrl_key_map = list(\n        list(key = \"right\", value = \" %>% \")\n    )\n)\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n#### Unicode doesn't work in Windows and R 4.2+.\n\nThe latest version of R supports Unicode codepage directly. However, radian relies on Python and Python doesn't support Unicode in the way that R supports it. A workaround could be found here: https://github.com/randy3k/radian/issues/269#issuecomment-1169663251. Though it may break the ploting device (running `plot()` will kill radian).\n\n\n#### I can't specify python runtime in reticulate.\n\nIt is expected. `radian` runs on python and the python runtime used by radian is forced in \nreticulate. `reticulate::py_config()` gives the note:\n```\nNOTE: Python version was forced by the current process\n```\n\nIn order to use radian with another python runtime, you will need to install `radian` on\nthat python environment.\n\n\n#### How to switch to a different R or specify the version of R.\n\nThere are serveral options.\n\n- The easiest option is to pass the path to the R binary with `--r-binary`, i.e., `radian --r-binary=/path/to/R`\n- Also, one could expose the path to the R binary in the `PATH` variable\n- The environment variable `R_BINARY` could also be used to specify the path to R.\n- The environment variable `R_HOME` could also be used to specify R home directory. Note that it is should be set as the result of `R.home()`, not the directory where `R` is located. For example, in Unix\n```sh\n$ env R_HOME=/usr/local/lib/R radian\n```\n\n#### Cannot find shared library\n\nPlease also make sure that R was installed with the R shared library `libR.so` or `libR.dylib` or `libR.dll`. On Linux, the configure flag `./configure --enable-R-shlib` may be needed to install R from the source. Do not forget to `make clean` to force the recompilation of the files with the correct compiler options.\n\n\n#### Outdated setuptools\n\nIf you encounter\n\n> The package setup script has attempted to modify files on your system that are not within the EasyInstall build area.\n\nPlease update your setuptools by\n\n```\npip install -U setuptools\n\n```\n\n\n#### How to use local history file\n\n_radian_ maintains its own history file `.radian_history` and doesn't use the `.Rhistory` file. A local `.radian_history` is used if it is found in the launch directory. Otherwise, the global history file `~/.radian_history` would be used. To override the default behavior, you could launch _radian_ with the options: `radian --local-history`, `radian --global-history` or `radian --no-history`.\n\n\n#### Does it slow down my R program?\n\n_radian_ only provides a frontend to the R program, the actual running eventloop is the same as that of the traditional R console. There is no performance sacrifice (or gain) while using this modern command line interface. \n\nHowever, it was reported that radian may be slower when using parallel computation, specifially when using forking. User should take extra care in those cases.\n\n#### Nvim-R support\n\nPut\n```vim\nlet R_app = \"radian\"\nlet R_cmd = \"R\"\nlet R_hl_term = 0\nlet R_args = []  \" if you had set any\nlet R_bracketed_paste = 1\n```\nin your vim config. \n\n\n#### `reticulate` Auto Completions\n\nTo enable reticulate prompt completions, make sure that `jedi` is installed.\n\n```sh\npip install jedi\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you use conda,\n```sh\nconda install -c conda-forge jedi\n```\n\n\n#### Prompt not shown inside a docker container\n\nIt maybe caused by the invalid terminal size, try running `stty size` in your terminal\nto see if it returns a correct size. You could change the values of it from the environmental variables\n`$COLUMNS` and `$LINES` when you log-in the docker container.\n\n```\ndocker exec -it <container> bash -c \"stty cols $COLUMNS rows $LINES && bash\"\n```\n\n## Why called _radian_?\n\n_radian_ is powered by (π)thon.\n\n## Credits\n\n_radian_ wouldn't be possible without the creative work
