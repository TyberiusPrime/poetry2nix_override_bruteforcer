Python package for revising function signatures at runtime.\nThis libraries aim is to help you write better, more literate code with less boilerplate.\n\n.. overview-end\n\n\n.. installation-start\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n``forge`` is a Python-only package `hosted on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/python-forge>`_ for **Python 3.5+**.\n\nThe recommended installation method is `pip-installing <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ into a `virtualenv <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_:\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n    $ pip install python-forge\n\n.. installation-end\n\n\n\nExample\n=======\n\n.. example-start\n\nConsider a library like `requests <https://github.com/requests/requests>`_ that provides a useful API for performing HTTP requests.\nEvery HTTP method has it's own function which is a thin wrapper around ``requests.Session.request``.\nThe code is a little more than 150 lines, with about 90% of that being boilerplate.\nUsing ``forge`` we can get that back down to about 10% it's current size, while *increasing* the literacy of the code.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import forge\n    import requests\n\n    request = forge.copy(requests.Session.request, exclude='self')(requests.request)\n\n    def with_method(method):\n        revised = forge.modify(\n            'method', default=method, bound=True,\n            kind=forge.FParameter.POSITIONAL_ONLY,\n        )(request)\n        revised.__name__ = method.lower()\n        return revised\n\n    post = with_method('POST')\n    get = with_method('GET')\n    put = with_method('PUT')\n    delete = with_method('DELETE')\n    options = with_method('OPTIONS')\n    head = with_method('HEAD')\n    patch = with_method('PATCH')\n\nSo what happened?\nThe first thing we did was create an alternate ``request`` function to replace ``requests.request`` that provides the exact same functionality but makes its parameters explicit:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    # requests.get() looks like this:\n    assert forge.repr_callable(requests.get) == 'get(url, params=None, **kwargs)'\n\n    # our get() calls the same code, but looks like this:\n    assert forge.repr_callable(get) == (\n        'get(url, params=None, data=None, headers=None, cookies=None, '\n            'files=None, auth=None, timeout=None, allow_redirects=True, '\n            'proxies=None, hooks=None, stream=None, verify=None, cert=None, '\n            'json=None'\n        ')'\n    )\n\nNext, we built a factory function ``with_method`` that creates new functions which make HTTP requests with the proper HTTP verb.\nBecause the ``method`` parameter is bound, it won't show up it is removed from the resulting functions signature.\nOf course, the signature of these generated functions remains explicit, let's try it out:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    response = get('http://google.com')\n    assert 'Feeling Lucky' in response.text\n\nYou can review the alternate code (the actual implementation) by visiting the code for `requests.api <https://github.com/requests/requests/blob/991e8b76b7a9d21f698b24fa0058d3d5968721bc/requests/api.py>`_.\n\n..
