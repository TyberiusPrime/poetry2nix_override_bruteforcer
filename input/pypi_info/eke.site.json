Sites,\nstaff members, and investigators are integral parts of the EDRN Knowledge\nEnvironment (EKE_).  EDRN uses the EKE to make it easy to discover, share,\nsearch for, and retrieve all of EDRN's collective knowledge, including cancers\nand other diseases, biomarkers, specimens, participants, studies, protocols,\nand-as in the case of this product-sites and staff.\n\nAlthough intended for the EDRN public portal, it can be installed in any\nPlone_ compatible site.\n\nThis software is developed by the `EDRN Informatics Center`_  at JPL_,\noperated by the California Institute of Technology, for NCI_.\n\n..
