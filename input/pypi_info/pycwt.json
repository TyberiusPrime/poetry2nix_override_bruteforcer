It includes a\ncollection of routines for wavelet transform and statistical analysis via FFT\nalgorithm. In addition, the module also includes cross-wavelet transforms,\nwavelet coherence tests and sample scripts.\n\nPlease read the documentation `here <http://pycwt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__\\.\n\nThis module requires ``NumPy``, ``SciPy``, ``tqdm``. In addition, you will \nalso need ``matplotlib`` to run the examples.\n\nThe sample scripts (``sample.py``, ``sample_xwt.py``) illustrate the use of\nthe wavelet and inverse wavelet transforms, cross-wavelet transform and\nwavelet transform coherence. Results are plotted in figures similar to the\nsample images.\n\n\nDisclaimer\n----------\n\nThis module is based on routines provided by C. Torrence and G. P. Compo\navailable at http://paos.colorado.edu/research/wavelets/, on routines\nprovided by A. Grinsted, J. Moore and S. Jevrejeva available at\nhttp://noc.ac.uk/using-science/crosswavelet-wavelet-coherence, and\non routines provided by A. Brazhe available at\nhttp://cell.biophys.msu.ru/static/swan/.\n\nThis software is released under a BSD-style open source license. Please read\nthe license file for further information. This routine is provided as is\nwithout any express or implied warranties whatsoever.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nWe recommend using PyPI to install this package.\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n    $ pip install pycwt\n\nHowever, if you want to install directly from GitHub, use:\n\n.. code-block:: sh\n\n    $ pip install git+https://github.com/regeirk/pycwt\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\nWe would like to thank Christopher Torrence, Gilbert P. Compo, Aslak Grinsted,\nJohn Moore, Svetlana Jevrejevaand and Alexey Brazhe for their code and also\nJack Ireland and Renaud Dussurget for their attentive eyes, feedback and\ndebugging.\n\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n- Sebastian Krieger\n- Nabil Freij\n- Ken Mankoff\n- Aaron Nielsen\n- Rodrigo Nemmen\n- Ondrej Grover\n- Joscelin Rocha Hidalgo\n- Stuart Mumford\n- ymarcon1\n- Tariq Hassan\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n1.
