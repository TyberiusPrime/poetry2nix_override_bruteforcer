Change the version in __init__.py, setup.py as well as docs/source/conf.py.\n\n2. Commit these changes with the message: \"Release: VERSION\"\n\n3. Add a tag in git to mark the release: \"git tag VERSION -m'Adds tag VERSION for pypi' \"\n   Push the tag to git: git push --tags origin master\n\n4. Build both the sources and the wheel. Do not change anything in setup.py between\n   creating the wheel and the source distribution (obviously).\n\n   For the wheel, run: \"python setup.py bdist_wheel\" in the top level directory.\n   (this will build a wheel for the python version you use to build it).\n\n   For the sources, run: \"python setup.py sdist\"\n   You should now have a /dist directory with both .whl and .tar.gz source versions.\n\n   Then change the SCRIPTS_VERSION back to to \"master\" in __init__.py (but don't commit this change)\n\n5. Check that everything looks correct by uploading the package to the pypi test server:\n\n   twine upload dist/* -r pypitest\n   (pypi suggest using twine as other methods upload files via plaintext.)\n   You may have to specify the repository url, use the following command then:\n   twine upload dist/* -r pypitest --repository-url=https://test.pypi.org/legacy/\n\n   Check that you can install it in a virtualenv by running:\n   pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi datasets\n\n6. Upload the final version to actual pypi:\n   twine upload dist/* -r pypi\n\n7. Copy the release notes from RELEASE.md to the tag in github once everything is looking hunky-dory.\n\n8. Update the documentation commit in .circleci/deploy.sh for the accurate documentation to be displayed\n   Update the version mapping in docs/source/_static/js/custom.js\n\n9. Update README.md to redirect to correct documentation.\n\n\n","description_content_type":"","docs_url":null,"download_url":"https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface/tags","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface","keywords":"","license":"Apache 2.0","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"huggingface","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/huggingface/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/huggingface/","project_urls":{"Download":"https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface/tags","Homepage":"https://github.com/huggingface/huggingface"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/huggingface/0.0.1/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":"","summary":"HuggingFace is a single library comprising the main HuggingFace libraries.","version":"0.0.1","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":23013610,"releases":{"0.0.1":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"f48ce61fbc39c0a37140e1d4941c4af29e2d53bacf9f4559e3de24d8f4e484f0","md5":"f54dd9018ae3e3b2a7b643be10cc0bc1","sha256":"98a3409537557cd2fd768997ef94cab08529f86c5e106e6d54bbabdd5ee03910"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"huggingface-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"f54dd9018ae3e3b2a7b643be10cc0bc1","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":null,"size":2455,"upload_time":"2020-12-18T18:36:59","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-12-18T18:36:59.096618Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f4/8c/e61fbc39c0a37140e1d4941c4af29e2d53bacf9f4559e3de24d8f4e484f0/huggingface-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"9da4168b574a23c1841fab5b24ecac98a88ea626ea3c746c481f79eb360c81f2","md5":"19034b17b7e6baf9521f63e2df65f1fb","sha256":"0a2f228fd956801d68b7c6a8bef478dfa60c4b7d7eba572ea7de39ecf87e505a"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"huggingface-0.0.1.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"19034b17b7e6baf9521f63e2df65f1fb","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":2320,"upload_time":"2020-12-18T18:37:00","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-12-18T18:37:00.599735Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/9d/a4/168b574a23c1841fab5b24ecac98a88ea626ea3c746c481f79eb360c81f2/huggingface-0.0.1.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"f48ce61fbc39c0a37140e1d4941c4af29e2d53bacf9f4559e3de24d8f4e484f0","md5":"f54dd9018ae3e3b2a7b643be10cc0bc1","sha256":"98a3409537557cd2fd768997ef94cab08529f86c5e106e6d54bbabdd5ee03910"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"huggingface-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"f54dd9018ae3e3b2a7b643be10cc0bc1","packagetype":"bdist_wheel","python_version":"py3","requires_python":null,"size":2455,"upload_time":"2020-12-18T18:36:59","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-12-18T18:36:59.096618Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f4/8c/e61fbc39c0a37140e1d4941c4af29e2d53bacf9f4559e3de24d8f4e484f0/huggingface-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"9da4168b574a23c1841fab5b24ecac98a88ea626ea3c746c481f79eb360c81f2","md5":"19034b17b7e6baf9521f63e2df65f1fb","sha256":"0a2f228fd956801d68b7c6a8bef478dfa60c4b7d7eba572ea7de39ecf87e505a"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"huggingface-0.0.1.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"19034b17b7e6baf9521f63e2df65f1fb","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":2320,"upload_time":"2020-12-18T18:37:00","upload_time_iso_8601":"2020-12-18T18:37:00.599735Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/9d/a4/168b574a23c1841fab5b24ecac98a88ea626ea3c746c481f79eb360c81f2/huggingface-0.0.1.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
