That is, Lineax provides routines that solve for $x$ in $Ax = b$. (Even when $A$ may be ill-posed or rectangular.)\n\nFeatures include:\n- PyTree-valued matrices and vectors;\n- General linear operators for Jacobians, transposes, etc.;\n- Efficient linear least squares (e.g. QR solvers);\n- Numerically stable gradients through linear least squares;\n- Support for structured (e.g. symmetric) matrices;\n- Improved compilation times;\n- Improved runtime of some algorithms;\n- Support for both real-valued and complex-valued inputs;\n- All the benefits of working with JAX: autodiff, autoparallelism, GPU/TPU support, etc.\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\npip install lineax\n```\n\nRequires Python 3.9+, JAX 0.4.13+, and [Equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox) 0.11.0+.\n\n## Documentation\n\nAvailable at [https://docs.kidger.site/lineax](https://docs.kidger.site/lineax).\n\n## Quick examples\n\nLineax can solve a least squares problem with an explicit matrix operator:\n\n```python\nimport jax.random as jr\nimport lineax as lx\n\nmatrix_key, vector_key = jr.split(jr.PRNGKey(0))\nmatrix = jr.normal(matrix_key, (10, 8))\nvector = jr.normal(vector_key, (10,))\noperator = lx.MatrixLinearOperator(matrix)\nsolution = lx.linear_solve(operator, vector, solver=lx.QR())\n```\n\nor Lineax can solve a problem without ever materializing a matrix, as done in this\nquadratic solve:\n\n```python\nimport jax\nimport lineax as lx\n\nkey = jax.random.PRNGKey(0)\ny = jax.random.normal(key, (10,))\n\ndef quadratic_fn(y, args):\n  return jax.numpy.sum((y - 1)**2)\n\ngradient_fn = jax.grad(quadratic_fn)\nhessian = lx.JacobianLinearOperator(gradient_fn, y, tags=lx.positive_semidefinite_tag)\nsolver = lx.CG(rtol=1e-6, atol=1e-6)\nout = lx.linear_solve(hessian, gradient_fn(y, args=None), solver)\nminimum = y - out.value\n```\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you found this library to be useful in academic work, then please cite: ([arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17283))\n\n```bibtex\n@article{lineax2023,\n    title={Lineax: unified linear solves and linear least-squares in JAX and Equinox},\n    author={Jason Rader and Terry Lyons and Patrick Kidger},\n    journal={\n        AI for science workshop at Neural Information Processing Systems 2023,\n        arXiv:2311.17283\n    },\n    year={2023},\n}\n```\n\n(Also consider starring the project on GitHub.)\n\n## Finally\n\n### See also: other libraries in the JAX ecosystem\n\n[jaxtyping](https://github.com/google/jaxtyping): type annotations for shape/dtype of arrays.\n\n[Equinox](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/equinox): neural networks.\n\n[Optax](https://github.com/deepmind/optax): first-order gradient (SGD, Adam, ...) optimisers.\n\n[Diffrax](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax): numerical differential equation solvers.\n\n[Optimistix](https://github.com/patrick-kidger/optimistix): root finding, minimisation, fixed points, and least squares.\n\n[BlackJAX](https://github.com/blackjax-devs/blackjax): probabilistic+Bayesian sampling.\n\n[Orbax](https://github.com/google/orbax): checkpointing (async/multi-host/multi-device).\n\n[sympy2jax](https://github.com/google/sympy2jax): SymPy<->JAX conversion; train symbolic expressions via gradient descent.\n\n[Eqxvision](https://github.com/paganpasta/eqxvision): computer vision models.\n\n[Levanter](https://github.com/stanford-crfm/levanter): scalable+reliable training of foundation models (e.g. LLMs).\n\n[PySR](https://github.com/milesCranmer/PySR): symbolic regression.
