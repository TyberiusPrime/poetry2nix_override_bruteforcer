This README is meant for consumption by humans and pypi. Pypi can render rst files so please do not use Sphinx features.\n   If you want to learn more about writing documentation, please check out: http://docs.plone.org/about/documentation_styleguide.html\n   This text does not appear on pypi or github. It is a comment.\n\n===================\nvisaplan.plone.base\n===================\n\nThis package simply collects some basic constants etc. (e.g. permission names)\nwhich are used by other packages, e.g. ``visaplan.plone.browsers``.\n\nIt is part of the footing of the \"Unitracc family\" of Plone sites\nwhich are maintained by visaplan GmbH, Bochum, Germany.\n\nSome parts of this package might be outdated now and not anymore considered to\nfollow Plone's current Best Practices.  The reason is:\n\nThe purpose of this package (for now) is *not* to provide new functionality\nbut to factor out existing functionality from our former monolithic Zope product.\nLater versions might reflect more recent insights and/or the requirements of\nmore recent Zope/Plone versions.\n\nThis package does still contain some resources (e.g. permission names) which\nare specific to our \"Unitracc family\" of sites; thus, we considere it more\nlikely you to create your own *yourcompany*.plone.base fork than to use this\npackage directly.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- ``exceptions`` module\n\n  - Provides the ``UnitraccBaseException`` class which supports the\n    localization of error messages which are presented to the users\n\n  - Some more exception classes.\n\n- ``permissions`` module\n\n  Imports some permission names from the Zope/Plone packages,\n  and adds some proprietary permission names from our \"Unitracc family\".\n\n- ``typestr`` module\n\n  Creates dictionaries for the localization (l10n) of strings related to object\n  type names; e.g., for your portal_type ``thingy`` you might want a Gettext\n  message id ``thingies``, and perhaps as well ``My thingies`` and others.\n\n  When calles as a script, the module creates a honeypot file for use by\n  extraction tools.\n\n- ``adapter`` module\n\n  A \"Base\" class for the adapters of ``visaplan.plone.adapters``\n  which saves the ``context`` (given during adapter creation) to an attribute\n  and calls (probably for historical reasons) the ``reference_catalog`` tool\n  (this may change in the future).\n\n- the ``browserview`` module\n\n  Provides an extended version of the ``Products.Five.BrowserView``\n  (hwich may as well change in the future).\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nThis add-on can be seen in action at the following sites:\n\n- https://www.unitracc.de\n- https://www.unitracc.com\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall visaplan.plone.base by adding it to your buildout::\n\n    [buildout]\n\n    ...\n\n    eggs =\n        visaplan.plone.base\n\n\nand then running ``bin/buildout``\n\n\nContribute\n----------\n\n- Issue Tracker: https://github.com/visaplan/visaplan.plone.base/issues\n- Source Code: https://github.com/visaplan/visaplan.plone.base\n\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nIf you are having issues, please let us know;\nplease use the issue tracker mentioned above.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe project is licensed under the GPLv2.\n\n.. vim: tw=79 cc=+1 sw=4 sts=4 si et\n\n\nContributors\n============\n\n- Tobias Herp, tobias.herp@visaplan.com\n\n\nChangelog\n=========\n\n\n1.1 (2018-09-17)\n----------------\n\n- First public release.\n  [tobiasherp]","description_content_type":"","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.plone.base","keywords":"","license":"GPL version 2","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"visaplan.plone.base","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.plone.base/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.plone.base/","project_urls":{"Homepage":"https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.plone.base"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/visaplan.plone.base/1.1/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":"","summary":"Base modules for UNITRACC, a Plone customization","version":"1.1","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":4278679,"releases":{"1.0.dev1":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"5972a21e223485f5b3adfb9f96276c6643def7e512a0ec64db50986dd594dc5c","md5":"7e1e246dea2db66a1201dd1edc7d56cb","sha256":"e5181bb390cc7ad38c0907400859404b8e019981f436341f8d0c194f6e7cc6e5"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"visaplan.plone.base-1.0.dev1.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"7e1e246dea2db66a1201dd1edc7d56cb","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":12375,"upload_time":"2018-08-10T15:27:47","upload_time_iso_8601":"2018-08-10T15:27:47.940340Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/59/72/a21e223485f5b3adfb9f96276c6643def7e512a0ec64db50986dd594dc5c/visaplan.plone.base-1.0.dev1.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"1.1":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"ad5e20d589eb59cdf56a8684caed1a04c8832fd2b627450e6584fbaa31da6ad7","md5":"222cf60027d795482be89678536a5a71","sha256":"20c616f49a2743d3c6c5f97de6cc56c60b86a7b3d40bcbc092fa6c9d5780b32a"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"visaplan.plone.base-1.1.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"222cf60027d795482be89678536a5a71","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":17360,"upload_time":"2018-09-17T09:11:55","upload_time_iso_8601":"2018-09-17T09:11:55.025077Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ad/5e/20d589eb59cdf56a8684caed1a04c8832fd2b627450e6584fbaa31da6ad7/visaplan.plone.base-1.1.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"ad5e20d589eb59cdf56a8684caed1a04c8832fd2b627450e6584fbaa31da6ad7","md5":"222cf60027d795482be89678536a5a71","sha256":"20c616f49a2743d3c6c5f97de6cc56c60b86a7b3d40bcbc092fa6c9d5780b32a"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"visaplan.plone.base-1.1.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"222cf60027d795482be89678536a5a71","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":17360,"upload_time":"2018-09-17T09:11:55","upload_time_iso_8601":"2018-09-17T09:11:55.025077Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/ad/5e/20d589eb59cdf56a8684caed1a04c8832fd2b627450e6584fbaa31da6ad7/visaplan.plone.base-1.1.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
