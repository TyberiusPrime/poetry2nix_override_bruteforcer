It simply prints the PyPI packages that need to be installed. In the terminal it can be combined directly with a `pip install` command, as per the last example below:\n\n<table>\n<tr><td>Usage:</td><td>Alternatively through MkDocs itself:</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n\n```bash\n# Print dependencies of the current project\nmkdocs-get-deps\n# Save them into a file\nmkdocs-get-deps > requirements.txt\n# Install dependencies on the fly\npip install $(mkdocs-get-deps)\n```\n\n</td><td>\n\n```bash\n\nmkdocs get-deps\n\nmkdocs get-deps > requirements.txt\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\npip install $(mkdocs get-deps)\n```\n\n</td>\n</tr></table>\n\nThe idea is that right after running this command, you can directly follow it up with `mkdocs build` and it will almost always \"just work\", without needing to think which dependencies to install.\n\nThe way it works is by scanning [`mkdocs.yml`] for `themes:`, `plugins:`, `markdown_extensions:` items and doing a reverse lookup based on a large list of known projects (catalog, see below).\n\nOf course, you're encouraged to use a \"virtualenv\" with such a command. Also note that for environments that require stability (for example CI) directly installing deps in this way is not a very reliable approach as it precludes dependency pinning.\n\nThe command allows overriding which config file is used (instead of `mkdocs.yml` in the current directory) as well as which catalog of projects is used (instead of downloading it from the default location). See [`mkdocs get-deps --help`](https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/cli/#mkdocs-get-deps).\n\n## MkDocs' official catalog of plugins\n\nCheck out <https://github.com/mkdocs/catalog> and add all your general-purpose plugins, themes and extensions there, so that they can be looked up through `mkdocs get-deps`.\n\n[MkDocs]: https://www.mkdocs.org/\n[`mkdocs.yml`]: https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/configuration/\n","description_content_type":"text/markdown","docs_url":null,"download_url":"","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"","keywords":"mkdocs","license":"","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"mkdocs-get-deps","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-get-deps/","platform":null,"project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-get-deps/","project_urls":{"History":"https://github.com/mkdocs/get-deps/releases","Issues":"https://github.com/mkdocs/get-deps/issues","Source":"https://github.com/mkdocs/get-deps"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/mkdocs-get-deps/0.2.0/","requires_dist":["importlib-metadata>=4.3;
