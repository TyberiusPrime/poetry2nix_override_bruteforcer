It\nworks by providing a distutils2-formatted setup.cfg file containing all of a\npackage's metadata, and a very minimal setup.py which will slurp its arguments\nfrom the setup.cfg.\n\nNote: distutils2 has been merged into the CPython standard library, where it is\nnow known as 'packaging'.  This project was started before that change was\nfinalized.  So all references to distutils2 should also be assumed to refer to\npackaging.\n\nRationale\n===========\nI'm currently in the progress of redoing the packaging of a sizeable number of\nprojects.  I wanted to use distutils2-like setup.cfg files for all these\nprojects, as they will hopefully be the future, and I much prefer them overall\nto using an executable setup.py.  So forward-support for distutils2 is\nappealing both as future-proofing, and simply the aesthetics of using a flat text file to describe a project's metadata.\n\nHowever, I did not want any of these projects to require distutils2 for\ninstallation yet--it is too unstable, and not widely installed.  So projects\nshould still be installable using the familiar `./setup.py install`, for\nexample.  Furthermore, not all use cases required by some of the packages I\nsupport are fully supported by distutils2 yet.  Hopefully they will be\neventually, either through the distutils2 core or through extensions.  But in\nthe meantime d2to1 will try to keep up with the state of the art and \"best\npractices\" for distutils2 distributions, while adding support in areas that\nit's lacking.\n\nUsage\n=======\nd2to1 requires a distribution to use distribute or setuptools.  Your\ndistribution must include a distutils2-like setup.cfg file, and a minimal\nsetup.py script.  For details on writing the setup.cfg, see the `distutils2\ndocumentation`_.  A simple sample can be found in d2to1's own setup.cfg (it\nuses its own machinery to install itself)::\n\n    [metadata]\n    name = d2to1\n    version = 0.2.12\n    author = Erik M.

It is also possible to set d2to1='some_file.cfg' to\nspecify the (relative) path of the setup.cfg file to use.  But in general this\nfunctionality should not be necessary.\n\nIt should also work fine if additional arguments are passed to `setup()`,\nbut it should be noted that they will be clobbered by any options in the\nsetup.cfg file.\n\nCaveats\n=======\n- The requires-dist option in setup.cfg is implemented through the\n  distribute/setuptools install_requires option, rather than the broken\n  \"requires\" keyword in normal distutils.\n- Not all features of distutils2 are supported yet.  If something doesn't seem\n  to be working, it's probably not implemented yet.\n- Does not support distutils2 resources, and probably won't since it relies\n  heavily on the sysconfig module only available in Python 3.2 and up.  This is\n  one area in which d2to1 should really be seen as a transitional tool.  I\n  don't really want to include a backport like distutils2 does.  In the\n  meantime, package_data and data_files may still be used under the [files]\n  section of setup.cfg.\n\n.. _distutils2 documentation: http://alexis.notmyidea.org/distutils2/setupcfg.html\n\nChanges\n=========\n\n0.2.12 (2015-07-16)\n-------------------\n\n- Fixed a corner case where depending on the order of events when installing\n  multiple packages (i.e. when installing packages with dependencies, some\n  of which might also use d2to1) we would end up calling the incorrect\n  Distribution class (the patched version from setuptools, where d2to1\n  needs to get to the unpatched version from distutils for some cases).\n\n- Upgraded bundled copy of the ``six`` module to the current version\n  (1.9.0).  This fixes incompatibility between d2to1 and other packages\n  that import different versions of ``six`` during their setup (the older\n  version of ``six`` had a habit of fighting with other ``six`` instances\n  over ``sys.modules``, which is fixed in newer versions).\n\n- Upgraded to latest ``ez_setup.py`` so that the most up to date version\n  of setuptools will be correctly bootstrapped in the rare cases that it\n  is needed.\n\n- Included some miscellaneous hacks to keep d2to1 working, nominally, with\n  Python 2.5 despite the broad move away from Python 2.5 support in the\n  Python community.  The d2to1 v0.2.x releases will be the last to continue\n  Python 2.5 support, given that testing it has become more difficult (and\n  the overhead is probably no longer worth it).\n\n\n0.2.11 (2013-08-29)\n-------------------\n\n- Replaced ``distribute_setup.py`` with ``ez_setup.py`` in order to bootstrap\n  with modern setuptools when necessary.\n\n- Fixed a couple minor Python 3-specific issues. In particular the\n  ``data_files`` option could be passed to ``setup()`` as a ``dict_items``\n  object instead of a ``list`` which is what would normally be expected.\n\n- Added a tox.ini (frankly I thought there already was one).\n\n\n0.2.10 (2013-04-10)\n-------------------\n\n- Added support for the ``setup-requires-dist`` option in the ``[metadata]``\n  section of setup.cfg.  This is analogous to the Setup-Requires-Dist metadata\n  field supported by PEP-426 and uses the ``setup_requires`` argument to\n  setuptools' ``setup()`` to implement it.\n\n- Added support for the ``dependency_links`` and ``include_package_data``\n  arguments to setuptools' ``setup()`` in the ``[backwards_compat]`` section of\n  setup.cfg.\n\n- When a setup_hook calls sys.exit() don't show a traceback for the\n  SystemExit exception.\n\n- Fixed a bug in the exception formatting when exceptions occur in setup.cfg\n  handling.\n\n\n0.2.9 (2013-03-05)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug in the extra-files supported added in 0.2.8.  Makes sure that\n  monkey-patches can't be installed more than once and that the log\n  reference is properly encapsulated.\n\n\n0.2.8 (2013-03-05)\n------------------\n\n- Improved handling of packages where the packages_root option is set. That is,\n  the Python package is not directly in the root of the source tree, but is in\n  some sub-directory.  Now the packages_root directory is prepended to\n  sys.path while processing the setup.cfg and running setup hooks.\n\n- Added support for the Keywords metadata field via the keywords option in the\n  ``[metadata]`` section of setup.cfg.\n\n- Fixed a missing import that caused a misleading exception when setup.cfg is\n  missing.\n\n- Upgraded the shipped distribute_setup.py to the latest for distribute 0.6.28\n\n- Added a few basic functional tests, along with an infrastructure to add more\n  as needed.  They can be run with nose and possibly with py.test though the\n  latter hasn't been tested.\n\n- Improved hook imports to work better with namespace packages.\n\n- Added support for the extra_files option of the ``[files]`` section in\n  setup.cfg.  This was a feature from distutils2 that provided an alternative\n  to MANIFEST.in for including additional files in source distributions (it\n  does not yet support wildcard patterns but maybe it should?)\n\n- Added support for the tests_require setup argument from setuptools via\n  the [backwards_compat] section in setup.cfg.\n\n- Supports Python 3 natively without 2to3.  This makes Python 3 testing of\n  d2to1 easier to support.\n\n\n0.2.7 (2012-02-20)\n------------------\n\n- If no extension modules or entry points are defined in the setup.cfg, don't\n  clobber any extension modules/entry points that may be defined in setup.py.\n\n\n0.2.6 (2012-02-17)\n------------------\n\n- Added support for setuptools entry points in an ``[entry_points]`` section of\n  setup.cfg--this is just for backwards-compatibility purposes, as\n  packaging/distutils2 does not yet have a standard replacement for the entry\n  points system.\n\n- Added a [backwards_compat] section for setup.cfg for other options that are\n  supported by setuptools/distribute, but that aren't part of the distutils2\n  standard.  So far the only options supported here are zip_safe and use_2to3.\n  (Note: packaging does support a use-2to3 option to the build command, but if\n  we tried to use that, distutils would not recognize it as a valid build\n  option.)\n\n- Added support for the new (and presumably final) extension section format\n  used by packaging.  In this format, extensions should be specified in config\n  sections of the format ``[extension: ext_mod_name]``, where any whitespace is\n  optional.  The old format used an ``=`` instead of ``:`` and is still\n  supported, but should be considered deprecated.\n\n- Added support for the new syntax used by packaging for the package_data\n  option (which is deprecated in packaging in favor of the resources system,\n  but still supported).  The new syntax is like::\n\n      package_data =\n          packagename = pattern1 pattern2 pattern3\n          packagename.subpack = \n              pattern1\n              pattern2\n              pattern3\n\n  That is, after ``package_data =``, give the name of a package, followed by\n  an ``=``, followed by any number of whitespace separated wildcard patterns (or\n  actual filenames relative to the package).  Under this scheme, whitespace is\n  not allowed in the patterns themselves.\n\n\n0.2.5 (2011-07-21)\n------------------\n\n- Made the call to pkg_resources.get_distribution() to set __version__ more\n  robust, so that it doesn't fail on, for example, VersionConflict errors\n\n\n0.2.4 (2011-07-05)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed some bugs with installation on Python 3\n\n\n0.2.3 (2011-06-23)\n------------------\n\n- Renamed 'setup_hook' to 'setup_hooks' as is now the case in the packaging\n  module.  Added support for multiple setup_hooks\n\n\n0.2.2 (2011-06-15)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed a bug in DefaultGetDict where it didn't actually save the returned\n  default in the dictionary--so any command options would get lost\n- Fixed a KeyError when the distribution does not have any custom commands\n  specified\n\n\n0.2.1 (2011-06-15)\n------------------\n\n- Reimplemented command hooks without monkey-patching and more reliably in\n  general (though it's still a flaming hack).  The previous monkey patch-based\n  solution would break if d2to1 were entered multiple times, which could happen\n  in some scenarios\n\n\n0.2.0 (2011-06-14)\n------------------\n\n- Version bump to start using micro-version numbers for bug fixes only, now\n  that the my primary feature goals are complete\n\n\n0.1.5 (2011-06-02)\n------------------\n\n- Adds support for the data_files option under [files].  Though this is\n  considered deprecated and may go away at some point, it can be useful in the\n  absence of resources support\n- Adds support for command pre/post-hooks.  Warning: this monkey-patches\n  distutils.dist.Distribution a little bit... :(\n- Adds (slightly naive) support for PEP 345-style version specifiers in\n  requires-dist (environment markers not supported yet)\n- Fixed a bug where not enough newlines were inserted between description files\n\n\n0.1.4 (2011-05-24)\n------------------\n\n- Adds support for custom command classes specified in the 'commands' option\n  under the [global] section in setup.cfg\n- Adds preliminary support for custom compilers specified in the 'compilers'\n  option under the [global] section in setup.cfg.  This functionality doesn't\n  exist in distutils/setuptools/distribute, so adding support for it is a\n  flaming hack.  It hasn't really been tested beyond seeing that the custom\n  compilers come up in `setup.py build_ext --help-compiler`, so any real-world\n  testing of this feature would be appreciated\n\n\n0.1.3 (2011-04-20)\n------------------\n\n- Adds zest.releaser entry points for updating the version number in a\n  setup.cfg file; only useful if you use zest.releaser--otherwise harmless\n  (might eventually move this functionality out into a separate product)\n- Though version 0.1.2 worked in Python3, use_2to3 wasn't added to the setup.py\n  so 2to3 had to be run manually\n- Fixed a crash on projects that don't have a description-file option\n\n0.1.2 (2011-04-13)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed the self-installation--it did not work if a d2to1 version was not\n  already installed, due to the use of `pkg_resources.require()`\n- Adds nominal Python3 support\n- Fixes the 'classifier' option in setup.cfg\n\n0.1.1 (2011-04-12)\n------------------\n\n- Fixed an unhelpful error message when a setup_hook fails to import\n- Made d2to1 able to use its own machinery to install itself","description_content_type":null,"docs_url":null,"download_url":"UNKNOWN","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/embray/d2to1","keywords":null,"license":"UNKNOWN","maintainer":null,"maintainer_email":null,"name":"d2to1","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/d2to1/","platform":"UNKNOWN","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/d2to1/","project_urls":{"Download":"UNKNOWN","Homepage":"https://github.com/embray/d2to1"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/d2to1/0.2.12.post1/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":null,"summary":"Allows
