Sending HTTP requests.\n\nIt does not provide any high level model abstractions over the API,\ndoes not handle redirects, multipart uploads, building authentication headers,\ntransparent HTTP caching, URL parsing, session cookie handling,\ncontent or charset decoding, handling JSON, environment based configuration\ndefaults, or any of that Jazz.\n\nSome things HTTP Core does do:\n\n* Sending HTTP requests.\n* Thread-safe / task-safe connection pooling.\n* HTTP(S) proxy & SOCKS proxy support.\n* Supports HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.\n* Provides both sync and async interfaces.\n* Async backend support for `asyncio` and `trio`.\n\n## Requirements\n\nPython 3.8+\n\n## Installation\n\nFor HTTP/1.1 only support, install with:\n\n```shell\n$ pip install httpcore\n```\n\nThere are also a number of optional extras available...\n\n```shell\n$ pip install httpcore['asyncio,trio,http2,socks']\n```\n\n# Sending requests\n\nSend an HTTP request:\n\n```python\nimport httpcore\n\nresponse = httpcore.request(\"GET\", \"https://www.example.com/\")\n\nprint(response)\n# <Response [200]>\nprint(response.status)\n# 200\nprint(response.headers)\n# [(b'Accept-Ranges', b'bytes'), (b'Age', b'557328'), (b'Cache-Control', b'max-age=604800'), ...]\nprint(response.content)\n# b'<!doctype html>\\n<html>\\n<head>\\n<title>Example Domain</title>\\n\\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\"/>\\n ...'\n```\n\nThe top-level `httpcore.request()` function is provided for convenience. In practice whenever you're working with `httpcore` you'll want to use the connection pooling functionality that it provides.\n\n```python\nimport httpcore\n\nhttp = httpcore.ConnectionPool()\nresponse = http.request(\"GET\", \"https://www.example.com/\")\n```\n\nOnce you're ready to get going, [head over to the documentation](https://www.encode.io/httpcore/).\n\n## Motivation\n\nYou *probably* don't want to be using HTTP Core directly. It might make sense if\nyou're writing something like a proxy service in Python, and you just want\nsomething at the lowest possible level, but more typically you'll want to use\na higher level client library, such as `httpx`.\n\nThe motivation for `httpcore` is:\n\n* To provide a reusable low-level client library, that other packages can then build on top of.\n* To provide a *really clear interface split* between the networking code and client logic,\n  so that each is easier to understand and reason about in isolation.\n\n## Dependencies\n\nThe `httpcore` package has the following dependencies...\n\n* `h11`\n* `certifi`\n\nAnd the following optional extras...\n\n* `anyio` - Required by `pip install httpcore['asyncio']`.\n* `trio` - Required by `pip install httpcore['trio']`.\n* `h2` - Required by `pip install httpcore['http2']`.\n* `socksio` - Required by `pip install httpcore['socks']`.\n\n## Versioning\n\nWe use [SEMVER for our versioning policy](https://semver.org/).\n\nFor changes between package versions please see our [project changelog](CHANGELOG.md).\n\nWe recommend pinning your requirements either the most current major version, or a more specific version range:\n\n```python\npip install 'httpcore==1.*'\n```\n# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).\n\n## 1.0.5 (March 27th, 2024)\n\n- Handle `EndOfStream` exception for anyio backend.

(Pull #428)\n\n## 0.14.0 (November 11th, 2021)\n\nThe 0.14 release is a complete reworking of `httpcore`, comprehensively addressing some underlying issues in the connection pooling, as well as substantially redesigning the API to be more user friendly.\n\nSome of the lower-level API design also makes the components more easily testable in isolation, and the package now has 100% test coverage.\n\nSee [discussion #419](https://github.com/encode/httpcore/discussions/419) for a little more background.\n\nThere's some other neat bits in there too, such as the \"trace\" extension, which gives a hook into inspecting the internal events that occur during the request/response cycle. This extension is needed for the HTTPX cli, in order to...\n\n* Log the point at which the connection is established, and the IP/port on which it is made.\n* Determine if the outgoing request should log as HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2, rather than having to assume it's HTTP/2 if the --http2 flag was passed. (Which may not actually be true.)\n* Log SSL version info / certificate info.\n\nNote that `curio` support is not currently available in 0.14.0. If you're using `httpcore` with `curio` please get in touch, so we can assess if we ought to prioritize it as a feature or not.\n\n## 0.13.7 (September 13th, 2021)\n\n- Fix broken error messaging when URL scheme is missing, or a non HTTP(S) scheme is used.

(Pull #358, #362)\n\n## 0.13.4 (June 9th, 2021)\n\n### Added\n\n- Improved error messaging when URL scheme is missing, or a non HTTP(S) scheme is used. (Pull #354)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Switched to `anyio` as the default backend implementation when running with `asyncio`. Resolves some awkward [TLS timeout issues](https://github.com/encode/httpx/discussions/1511).\n\n## 0.13.3 (May 6th, 2021)\n\n### Added\n\n- Support HTTP/2 prior knowledge, using `httpcore.SyncConnectionPool(http1=False)`. (Pull #333)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Handle cases where environment does not provide `select.poll` support. (Pull #331)\n\n## 0.13.2 (April 29th, 2021)\n\n### Added\n\n- Improve error message for specific case of `RemoteProtocolError` where server disconnects without sending a response. (Pull #313)\n\n## 0.13.1 (April 28th, 2021)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- More resiliant testing for closed connections. (Pull #311)\n- Don't raise exceptions on ungraceful connection closes. (Pull #310)\n\n## 0.13.0 (April 21st, 2021)\n\nThe 0.13 release updates the core API in order to match the HTTPX Transport API,\nintroduced in HTTPX 0.18 onwards.\n\nAn example of making requests with the new interface is:\n\n```python\nwith httpcore.SyncConnectionPool() as http:\n    status_code, headers, stream, extensions = http.handle_request(\n        method=b'GET',\n        url=(b'https', b'example.org', 443, b'/'),\n        headers=[(b'host', b'example.org'), (b'user-agent', b'httpcore')]\n        stream=httpcore.ByteStream(b''),\n        extensions={}\n    )\n    body = stream.read()\n    print(status_code, body)\n```\n\n### Changed\n\n- The `.request()` method is now `handle_request()`. (Pull #296)\n- The `.arequest()` method is now `.handle_async_request()`. (Pull #296)\n- The `headers` argument is no longer optional. (Pull #296)\n- The `stream` argument is no longer optional. (Pull #296)\n- The `ext` argument is now named `extensions`, and is no longer optional. (Pull #296)\n- The `\"reason\"` extension keyword is now named `\"reason_phrase\"`. (Pull #296)\n- The `\"reason_phrase\"` and `\"http_version\"` extensions now use byte strings for their values. (Pull #296)\n- The `httpcore.PlainByteStream()` class becomes `httpcore.ByteStream()`. (Pull #296)\n\n### Added\n\n- Streams now support a `.read()` interface. (Pull #296)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Task cancellation no longer leaks connections from the connection pool. (Pull #305)\n\n## 0.12.3 (December 7th, 2020)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Abort SSL connections on close rather than waiting for remote EOF when using `asyncio`.  (Pull #167)\n- Fix exception raised in case of connect timeouts when using the `anyio` backend. (Pull #236)\n- Fix `Host` header precedence for `:authority` in HTTP/2. (Pull #241, #243)\n- Handle extra edge case when detecting for socket readability when using `asyncio`. (Pull #242, #244)\n- Fix `asyncio` SSL warning when using proxy tunneling. (Pull #249)\n\n## 0.12.2 (November 20th, 2020)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Properly wrap connect errors on the asyncio backend. (Pull #235)\n- Fix `ImportError` occurring on Python 3.9 when using the HTTP/1.1 sync client in a multithreaded context.

(Pull #221)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Tweak detection of dropped connections, resolving an issue with open files limits on Linux. (Pull #185)\n- Avoid leaking connections when establishing an HTTP tunnel to a proxy has failed. (Pull #223)\n- Properly wrap OS errors when using `trio`. (Pull #225)\n\n## 0.12.0 (October 6th, 2020)\n\n### Changed\n\n- HTTP header casing is now preserved, rather than always sent in lowercase. (#216 and python-hyper/h11#104)\n\n### Added\n\n- Add Python 3.9 to officially supported versions.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Gracefully handle a stdlib asyncio bug when a connection is closed while it is in a paused-for-reading state. (#201)\n\n## 0.11.1 (September 28nd, 2020)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Add await to async semaphore release() coroutine (#197)\n- Drop incorrect curio classifier (#192)\n\n## 0.11.0 (September 22nd, 2020)\n\nThe Transport API with 0.11.0 has a couple of significant changes.\n\nFirstly we've moved changed the request interface in order to allow extensions, which will later enable us to support features\nsuch as trailing headers, HTTP/2 server push, and CONNECT/Upgrade connections.\n\nThe interface changes from:\n\n```python\ndef request(method, url, headers, stream, timeout):\n    return (http_version, status_code, reason, headers, stream)\n```\n\nTo instead including an optional dictionary of extensions on the request and response:\n\n```python\ndef request(method, url, headers, stream, ext):\n    return (status_code, headers, stream, ext)\n```\n\nHaving an open-ended extensions point will allow us to add later support for various optional features, that wouldn't otherwise be supported without these API changes.\n\nIn particular:\n\n* Trailing headers support.\n* HTTP/2 Server Push\n* sendfile.\n* Exposing raw connection on CONNECT, Upgrade, HTTP/2 bi-di streaming.\n* Exposing debug information out of the API, including template name, template context.\n\nCurrently extensions are limited to:\n\n* request: `timeout` - Optional. Timeout dictionary.\n* response: `http_version` - Optional. Include the HTTP version used on the response.\n* response: `reason` - Optional. Include the reason phrase used on the response. Only valid with HTTP/1.*.\n\nSee https://github.com/encode/httpx/issues/1274#issuecomment-694884553 for the history behind this.\n\nSecondly, the async version of `request` is now namespaced as `arequest`.\n\nThis allows concrete transports to support both sync and async implementations on the same class.\n\n### Added\n\n- Add curio support. (Pull #168)\n- Add anyio support, with `backend=\"anyio\"`. (Pull #169)\n\n### Changed\n\n- Update the Transport API to use 'ext' for optional extensions. (Pull #190)\n- Update the Transport API to use `.request` and `.arequest` so implementations can support both sync and async. (Pull #189)\n\n## 0.10.2 (August 20th, 2020)\n\n### Added\n\n- Added Unix Domain Socket support. (Pull #139)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Always include the port on proxy CONNECT requests. (Pull #154)\n- Fix `max_keepalive_connections` configuration. (Pull #153)\n- Fixes behaviour in HTTP/1.1 where server disconnects can be used to signal the end of the response body. (Pull #164)\n\n## 0.10.1 (August 7th, 2020)\n\n- Include `max_keepalive_connections` on `AsyncHTTPProxy`/`SyncHTTPProxy` classes.\n\n## 0.10.0 (August 7th, 2020)\n\nThe most notable change in the 0.10.0 release is that HTTP/2 support is now fully optional.\n\nUse either `pip install httpcore` for HTTP/1.1 support only, or `pip install httpcore[http2]` for HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 support.\n\n### Added\n\n- HTTP/2 support becomes optional. (Pull #121, #130)\n- Add `local_address=...` support. (Pull #100, #134)\n- Add `PlainByteStream`, `IteratorByteStream`, `AsyncIteratorByteStream`.
