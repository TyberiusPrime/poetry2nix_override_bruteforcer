There will be no more updates. It is recommended to use the official Neo4j drivers instead.** **\n\nThe version history of py2neo on PyPI got lost.\nIf you need an older version, you can install [`py2neo-history`](https://pypi.org/project/py2neo-history/) instead.\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/py2neo.svg\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2neo\n   :alt: PyPI version\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/py2neo\n   :target: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/py2neo\n   :alt: PyPI Downloads\n\n.. image:: https://img.shields.io/github/license/neo4j-contrib/py2neo.svg\n   :target: https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n   :alt: License\n\n.. image:: https://coveralls.io/repos/github/neo4j-contrib/py2neo/badge.svg?branch=master\n   :target: https://coveralls.io/github/neo4j-contrib/py2neo?branch=master\n   :alt: Coverage Status\n\n\n**Py2neo** is a client library and toolkit for working with `Neo4j <https://neo4j.com/>`_ from within `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ applications.\nThe library supports both Bolt and HTTP and provides a high level API, an OGM, admin tools, a Cypher lexer for Pygments, and many other bells and whistles.\n\nCommand line tooling has been removed from the library in py2neo 2021.2.\nThis functionality now exists in the separate **ipy2neo** project.\n\nAs of version 2021.1, py2neo contains full support for routing, as exposed by a Neo4j cluster.\nThis can be enabled using a ``neo4j://...`` URI or by passing ``routing=True`` to a ``Graph`` constructor.\n\n\nInstallation & Compatibility\n----------------------------\n\nTo install the latest release of py2neo, simply use:\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install py2neo\n\nThe following versions of Python and Neo4j (all editions) are supported:\n\n.. list-table::\n    :header-rows: 1\n\n    * - Neo4j\n      - Python 3.5+\n      - Python 2.7\n    * - 4.4\n      - |test-neo44-py35+|\n      - |test-neo44-py27|\n    * - 4.3\n      - |test-neo43-py35+|\n      - |test-neo43-py27|\n    * - 4.2\n      - |test-neo42-py35+|\n      - |test-neo42-py27|\n    * - 4.1\n      - |test-neo41-py35+|\n      - |test-neo41-py27|\n    * - 4.0\n      - |test-neo40-py35+|\n      - |test-neo40-py27|\n    * - 3.5\n      - |test-neo35-py35+|\n      - |test-neo35-py27|\n    * - 3.4\n      - |test-neo34-py35+|\n      - |test-neo34-py27|\n\nNote that py2neo is developed and tested under **Linux** using standard CPython distributions.\nWhile other operating systems and Python distributions may work, support for these is not available.\n\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\nTo run a query against a local database is straightforward::\n\n    >>> from py2neo import Graph\n    >>> graph = Graph(\"bolt://localhost:7687\", auth=(\"neo4j\", \"password\"))\n    >>> graph.run(\"UNWIND range(1, 3) AS n RETURN n, n * n as n_sq\")\n       n | n_sq\n    -----|------\n       1 |    1\n       2 |    4\n       3 |    9\n\n\nReleases & Versioning\n---------------------\n\nAs of 2020, py2neo has switched to `Calendar Versioning <https://calver.org/>`_, using a scheme of ``YYYY.N.M``.\nHere, ``N`` is an incrementing zero-based number for each year, and ``M`` is a revision within that version (also zero-based).\n\nNo compatibility guarantees are given between versions, but as a general rule, a change in ``M`` should require little-to-no work within client applications,\nwhereas a change in ``N`` may require some work. A change to the year is likely to require a more significant amount of work to upgrade.\n\nNote that py2neo is developed on a rolling basis, so patches are not made to old versions.\nUsers will instead need to install the latest release to adopt bug fixes.\n\n\nMore\n----\n\nFor more information, read the `handbook <http://py2neo.org/>`_.\n\n\n.. |test-neo44-py27| image::
