{"info":{"author":"Ayke van Laethem","author_email":"aykevanlaethem@gmail.com","bugtrack_url":null,"classifiers":[],"description":"Zip file streamer for HTTP\n==========================\n\nSimilar systems/projects:\n\n* The `Nginx zip module\n  <https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/modules/zip/>`_. Only for Nginx, so\n  can't be used with other webservers.\n* `python-zipstream <https://github.com/allanlei/python-zipstream>`_. Does not\n  support calculating the file size beforehand or seeing through the file.\n\nUsage:\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    import zipseeker\n    \n    # Create an index\n    fp = zipseeker.ZipSeeker()\n    fp.add('some/file.txt')\n    fp.add('another/file.txt', 'file2.txt')\n    \n    # Calculate the total file size, e.g. for the Content-Length HTTP header.\n    contentLength = fp.size()\n    \n    # Calculate the last-modified date, e.g. for the Last-Modified HTTP header.\n    lastModified = fp.lastModified()\n    \n    # Send the ZIP file to the client\n    # Optionally add the start and end parameters for range requests.\n    # Note that the ZIP format doesn't support actually skipping parts of the file,\n    # as it needs to calculate the CRC-32 of every file at the end of the file.\n    fp.writeStream(outputFile)\n\nWhy?\n----\n\nWhile the file size of a ZIP file usually can't be calculated beforehand due to\ncompression, this is actually optional. The headers itself also have a pretty\nconstant size. That means that the whole file can have a predetermined file size\n(and modtime).\n\nThis is useful when you want to provide ZIP downloads of large directories with\nuncompressable files (e.g. images). The specific use case I created this media\nfile for was to provide downloads of whole photo albums without such\ninconveniences as requesting a downloading link in an e-mail, using a lot system\nresources for the creation of temporary files, and having to delete these files\nafterwards.\n\nOf course, it's possible to just stream a ZIP file, but that won't provide any\nprogress indication for file downloads and certainly doesn't support `Range\nrequests <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests>`_.\n\nFor more information, see the `Nginx zip module\n<https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/modules/zip/>`_.\n\nTODO\n----\n\n* Implement actual seeking in the file - this should be doable.\n* Use a CRC-32 cache that can be shared by the calling module.\n\n","description_content_type":null,"docs_url":null,"download_url":"https://github.com/aykevl/python-zipseeker/archive/v1.0.11.zip","downloads":{"last_day":-1,"last_month":-1,"last_week":-1},"dynamic":null,"home_page":"https://github.com/aykevl/python-zipseeker","keywords":"zip","license":"","maintainer":"","maintainer_email":"","name":"zipseeker","package_url":"https://pypi.org/project/zipseeker/","platform":"","project_url":"https://pypi.org/project/zipseeker/","project_urls":{"Download":"https://github.com/aykevl/python-zipseeker/archive/v1.0.11.zip","Homepage":"https://github.com/aykevl/python-zipseeker"},"provides_extra":null,"release_url":"https://pypi.org/project/zipseeker/1.0.11/","requires_dist":null,"requires_python":"","summary":"Create a streamable and (somewhat) seekable .ZIP file","version":"1.0.11","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null},"last_serial":3466370,"releases":{"1.0.10":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"210e7b7dccb3780ac304a04b5e78fb3a2fd5947b9e13a668b18e8b247516f900","md5":"68587463a1f1ee0b127ecdd46469e69a","sha256":"dc189961cbbcc53a65cc5b11ffdfc7f08d07f1594967c8c173ba26558cca9a88"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"zipseeker-1.0.10.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"68587463a1f1ee0b127ecdd46469e69a","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":5734,"upload_time":"2017-07-09T16:41:12","upload_time_iso_8601":"2017-07-09T16:41:12.868748Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/21/0e/7b7dccb3780ac304a04b5e78fb3a2fd5947b9e13a668b18e8b247516f900/zipseeker-1.0.10.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"1.0.11":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"352100435b5ea857c82ca47d305fbd569bb07d0f459100cdde8520eda2fd3139","md5":"32b2d1e6ca5b213d2fd9b701cea6e2a5","sha256":"f0bc6b8dd5a66a8e09c98cb41ffeb31b83e2fc99d3f947afeda60c7605210e82"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"zipseeker-1.0.11.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"32b2d1e6ca5b213d2fd9b701cea6e2a5","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":5772,"upload_time":"2018-01-06T03:00:08","upload_time_iso_8601":"2018-01-06T03:00:08.177280Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/35/21/00435b5ea857c82ca47d305fbd569bb07d0f459100cdde8520eda2fd3139/zipseeker-1.0.11.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"1.0.9":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"bcb0f7d2203ec4470c39cbcccb2ea32dc48c841f286d77c144c799299b5832a5","md5":"8241f216fd467db685e8d53b21aa99e9","sha256":"92fb3aabcb70c7fbb152fc7c96158f05722076e0e3ad9db5ee3222cd562d6aec"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"zipseeker-1.0.9.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"8241f216fd467db685e8d53b21aa99e9","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":5016,"upload_time":"2017-07-08T21:42:20","upload_time_iso_8601":"2017-07-08T21:42:20.388719Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/bc/b0/f7d2203ec4470c39cbcccb2ea32dc48c841f286d77c144c799299b5832a5/zipseeker-1.0.9.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}]},"urls":[{"comment_text":"","digests":{"blake2b_256":"352100435b5ea857c82ca47d305fbd569bb07d0f459100cdde8520eda2fd3139","md5":"32b2d1e6ca5b213d2fd9b701cea6e2a5","sha256":"f0bc6b8dd5a66a8e09c98cb41ffeb31b83e2fc99d3f947afeda60c7605210e82"},"downloads":-1,"filename":"zipseeker-1.0.11.tar.gz","has_sig":false,"md5_digest":"32b2d1e6ca5b213d2fd9b701cea6e2a5","packagetype":"sdist","python_version":"source","requires_python":null,"size":5772,"upload_time":"2018-01-06T03:00:08","upload_time_iso_8601":"2018-01-06T03:00:08.177280Z","url":"https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/35/21/00435b5ea857c82ca47d305fbd569bb07d0f459100cdde8520eda2fd3139/zipseeker-1.0.11.tar.gz","yanked":false,"yanked_reason":null}],"vulnerabilities":[]}
